       " \n",
       "Article 87a of the CRD VI mandates the EBA to issue guidelines on ESG risk management \n",

       "governance and social risks is a n ambitious target considering the less advanced data, \n",
       "methodological and  regulatory developments in social and govern ance  aspects. Therefore, \n",
       "while developing the current guidelines, the EBA has analysed three possible options:  \n",
       " \n",
       "Option 1: To focus equally on the three aspects . \n",
       "Option 2: To focus on environmental aspects only . \n",

       " \n",
       "Institutions should regularly assess the potential effects of ESG risks on the ir business model s \n",
       "and risk  profile . Such assessment will provid e the institution with a view on the financial \n",
       "materiality of ESG risks to which it is or may become exposed.  The adequacy of regularity in \n",
       "which such assessment sh ould  be carried out will ensure that the materiality of ESG risks \n",

       " \n",
       "Option 1: Every year for all institutions . \n",

       " \n",
       "The needed transition towards a more sustainable economy will lead to  new business \n",
       "opportunities but will also expose financial institutions to risks stemming from the transition.  \n",
       "Therefore, while developing the current guidelines, the EBA has analysed if banks should \n",
       "consider ESG risks when defining their business models and strategy. In particular, the EBA \n",
       "has analysed two possible options:  \n",
       " \n",

       " \n",
       "6) Materiality assessment  \n",
       " \n",
       "Appropriate risk managements frameworks as well as CRD -based  plans should be based on \n",
       "a robust materiality assessment of the ESG risks faced by institutions . Therefore, while \n",
       "developing the current guidelines, the EBA has analysed t hree  possible options:  \n",
       " \n",
       "Option 1: The materiality assessment  of ESG risks  should automatically define as material \n",
       "certain exposures based on their sector .  \n",
       "Option 2: Institutions should have full flexibility when defining the materiality of ESG risks \n",
       "independently from the sector of the exposure.  \n",
       "Option 3:  Institutions should consider certain criteria , exposures  and sectors  in their \n",
       "assessments while remaining responsible for determining their materiality , substantiat ing \n",
       "and document ing their assessments . \n",
       " \n",
       "7) Data and engagement with counterparties in relation to their transition plans  \n",
       " \n",
       "To formulate and implement  an adequate plan  to monitor and address ESG risks , institutions \n",
       "need to have information about the risks they face in the transition process  and engage \n",
       "clients . This includes using  information about their counterparties and their own risks during \n",
       "the transition process. Therefore, while developing the current guidelines, the EBA has \n",
       "analysed three  possible options regarding the engagement with counterparties:  \n",
       " \n",
       "Option 1: Institution s should engage and request all counterparties to submit a transition \n",
       "plan as part of the due diligence phase.  \n",
       "Option 2: Institution should engage and request large counterparties only to submit a \n",
       "transition plan as part of the due diligence phase.  \n",
       "Option 3: Institution should consider collect ing forward -looking plans of at least  large \n",

       "Option 1: To focus requirements on  short -term time horizons.  \n",
       "Option 2:  To focus requirements on  medium -term time horizons.  \n",

       " \n",
       "9) Plans’ targets  \n",
       " \n",
       "Institutions should define targe ts as part of the ir plans. Therefore, while developing the \n",
       "current guidelines, the EBA has analysed four  possible  options:  \n",
       "Option 1: To predefine the full list of metrics that institutions should target.  \n",
       "Option 2:  Not to predefine the list of metrics that institutions should target and allow \n",
       "institutions to define their own list of metrics.  \n",

       "while complementing them . \n",
       "E - Asse ssment of the options and preferred option  \n",
       "12.  In respect to the different options considered, the EBA has assessed their potential cost and \n",
       "benefits, and has selected a preferred option in the nine main areas considered:  \n",
       "1) Scope of the ESG risks covered by the guidelines  \n",
       " \n",
       "ESG risks include environmental, social and governance factors. Article 87a of the CRD VI  \n",
       "mandates the EBA to issue guidelines on management practices for the full scope of these risks. \n",
       "However, the EU and international regulatory developments for environmental risks are more \n",
       "advanced than for social and governance risks. Although it is import ant to continue the \n",
       "development of management practices for the full set of ESG factors, it is also important to allow \n",
       "enough time for institutions to introduce the ne cessary changes. Therefore, in order to reduce \n",
       "the burden for institutions and the time pressure to adapt to the new regulatory developments, \n",
       "it is considered that the guidelines should focus on environmental risk s mainly, although \n",
       "introducing some high -level requirements  to define the management practices for social and \n",
       "governance  risks . This is indeed in line with the  sequenced approach adopted under other EBA \n",
       "regulatory products (e.g. Pillar 3 ITS ). Therefore, the preferred option is Option 3: To mainly \n",
       "focus on environmental aspects but give some guidance on social and government aspects.   \n",
       " \n",
       "2) Frequency  of the materiality assessment of ESG risks  \n",
       " \n",
       "Institutions sh ould  perform their  ESG risk materiality assessment with sufficient frequency  to \n",
       "ensure that any development  in the external environment that could affect their exposure to \n",
       "ESG factors are adequately capture d. Focusing on the E factor, environmental changes can \n",
       "develop in a fast manner , for example in terms of new policies or technologies or shifts in market \n",
       "and consumer preferences,  potentially affecting the level of banks’ exposures to environmental \n",
       "risks . For these reasons, the EBA  consider s that banks’  materiality assessment should be carried \n",
       "out with a short -term periodicity to ensure that the relevant risk s are captured  sufficiently and \n",
       "in time . However, performing such assessment requires an intensive use of resources. It may be  \n",
       "disproportionate to request all types of institutions to perform such assessment with a regularity \n",
       "of up to a year,  as small institutions have limited  resources available and such request could be \n",
       "burdensome for them . An adequate balanced approach would allow SNCI s to perform the \n",

       "lar, risk management–taking into account the institution’s risk-bearing capacity–includes in \n",
       "particular the determination of appropriate strategies, as well as the establishment of appro-priate internal surveillance procedures. The inte rnal surveillance procedures comprise the in-\n",
       "ternal control system and internal audit.In particular, the internal control system covers \n",

Executive Summary  \nThe EBA is mandated  in accordance with Article 87a(5) of Directive 2013/36/EU to issue guidelines \non minimum standards and reference methodologies for  the identification, measurement, \nmanagement and monitoring of environmental, social and governance  (ESG) risks  by institutions . \nESG risks , in particular environmental risks  through transition and physical risk drivers , pos e \nchallenges to the safety and soundness of institutions and  may affect all traditional categories of \nfinancial risks to which they are exposed.  To ensure the resilience of the business model and risk \nprofile of institutions in the short, medium and long term, the  guidelines set requirements for the \ninternal processes and ESG risk management arrangements that institutions should have in place . \nInstitutions, based on regular and comprehensive materiality assessments of ESG risks , should \nensure that they are able to properly identify and measure ESG risks through sound data processes \nand a combination of methodologies, including exposure -, portfolio - and sector -based , portfolio \nalignment  and scenario -based  methodologies.  \nInstitutio ns should integrate ESG risks in to their  regular  risk management framework by considering \ntheir  role as potential drivers of all traditional categories of financial risks, including credit, market, \noperational, reputational, liquidity, business model, and concentration risks.  Institutions should \nhave a robust and sound approach to managing and mitigating ESG risks over the short, medium \nand long term , including a time horizon of at least 10 years , and should apply  a range of risk \nmanagement tools  including engagement with counterparties . Institutions should embed ESG risks \nin th eir regular processes including  in the  risk appetite, internal controls and ICAAP. Besides, \ninstitutions should monitor ESG risks through effective internal reporting frameworks and a range \nof backward - and forward -looking ESG risk metrics and indicators.  \nInstitutions should develop specific  plans  to address the risks arising from the transition and process \nof adjustment of the economy  towards the regulatory objectives related  to ESG factors  of the \njurisdictions they operate in . To this end, institutions should  assess and embed forward -looking ESG \nrisk considerations in their strategies , policies  and risk management processes  through transition \nplanning  considering short -, medium - and long -term time horizons.  CRD -based  plans  take a risk -\nbased view and contribute to the overall resilience of institutions towards ESG risk s and should be \nconsistent with transition plans prepared or d isclosed by institutions  under other pieces of EU \nlegislation . \nNext steps  \nThe guidelines will apply from 11 January 2026  except  for small and non -complex institutions  for \nwhich the guidelines will apply  at the lates t from 11 January 2027.    \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n4 \n \n2. Background and rationale  \n2.1 Impact of ESG risks  \n1. Climate change, environmental degradation,  biodiversity loss,  social issues and other \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) factors pos e considerable challenges for the \neconomy. The impact of acute and chronic physical risk events, the need  to transition to a \nlow-carbon, resource -efficient and sustainable economy , as well as other ESG challenges , are \ncaus ing and will continue to cause  profound economic transformations that impact the \nfinancial sector.  \n2. The Commission’s Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy and the banking package (Directive \n2013/36/EU  (Capital Requirements Directive , CRD) and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital \nRequirements Regulation, CRR) ) recognise that t he financial sector has an important role to \nplay both in terms of supporting  the transition towards a climate -neutral and sustainable \neconomy , as enshrined in the Paris Agreement, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development and t he European Green Deal , and for managing  the financial risks \nthat this transition may entail and /or those stemming from  other  ESG factors.  \n3. Environmental  risks , including climate -related  risks , are expected inter alia  to become even \nmore prominent going forward through different possible combinations of transition and \nphysical risks. Th ese may affect all traditional categories of financial risks to which institutions \nare exposed. In addition , institutions’ counterparties or invested assets may be subject to the \nnegative impact of social factors , such as breaches of human rights, demographic change , \ndigitalisation, health or working conditions , and governanc e factors , such as shortcomings in \nexecutive leadership or bribery and corruption , which may in turn lead to financial risks  that \ninstitutions  should assess and manage .  \n4. To maintain adequate resilience to the negative impacts of ESG factors, institutions \nestablished in the EU need to be able to systematically identify, measure and manage ESG \nrisks. However , the specificities of ESG risks such as their forward -looking nature and distinct \nimpacts over various time horizons , as well as the lack of relevant historical experience , means \nthat understanding, measurement and management practices can differ significantly across \ninstitutions. The EBA’s observations stemming from the monitoring of supervisory colleges , \nas well as  supervisory experience from competent authorities , also show that the \nmanagement of ESG risks is still  at an early stage and  ‘work in progress ’, with only nascent \npractices on  ESG risks other than climate -related risks  in most EU institutions . Despite action  \ntaken in recent years , several shortcomings have been observed  in th e inclusion of ESG risks \nin business strategies and risk management frameworks that may pose  challenge s to the \nsafety and soundness of institutions  as the EU transitions towards a more sustainable \neconomy and the materialisation of ESG risks intensifies . \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n5 \n \n2.2 Legal mandate and objective of these guidelines  \n5. To enhance the prudential framework ’s focus  on ESG risks faced by institutions, new \nprovisions have been introduced and adjustments have been made to several Articles in the \nCRD and in the CRR. In particular  and to ensure a uniform understanding of ESG risks, \ndefinitions of ESG risks, environmental risk, physical risk, transition risk, social risk and \ngovernance risk have been  laid down in Article 4 of the CRR. Article s 73 and 74 of the CRD \nhave been amended to require that short -, medium - and long -term horizons of ESG risks be \nincluded in credit institutions’ strategies and processes for evaluating internal capital needs \nas well as adequate internal governance.  A reference to the current and forward -looking \nimpacts of ESG risks and a request for the management body to develop concrete plans to \naddress these risks have  also been  introduced in Article 76  of the CRD .  \n6. In addition, a  new Article 87a has been included in the  CRD , according to which : \n1. Competent authorities shall ensure that institutions have, as part of their robust \ngovernance arrangements including risk management framework required under \nArticle 74(1), robust strategies, policies, processes and systems for the \nidentification, measurem ent, management and monitoring of ESG risks over the \nshort, medium and long term . \n2. The strategies, policies, processes and systems referred to in paragraph 1 shall be \nproportionate to the scale, nature and complexity of the ESG risks of the business \nmodel and scope of the institution’s activities, and consider the short  and medium \nterm , and a long -term time horizon of at least 10 years.  \n3. Competent authorities shall ensure that institutions test their resilience to long -\nterm negative impacts of ESG factors, both under baseline and adverse scenarios \nwithin a given timeframe, starting with climate -related factors. For such resilience  \ntesting, competent authorities shall ensure that institutions include a number of \nESG scenarios reflecting potential impacts of environmental and social changes and \nassociated public policies on the long -term business environment . Competent \nauthorities shall ensur e that  in the resilience  testing  process,  institutions use \ncredible scenarios, based on the scenarios elaborated by international \norganisations . \n4. Competent authorities shall assess and monitor developments of institutions’ \npractices concerning their ESG strategy and risk management, including the plans , \nquantifiable targets and processes to monitor and address the ESG risks arising in \nthe short, medium and long -term, to be prepared in accordance with Article 76(2). \nThis assessment shall take into account the institutions’ sustainability -related \nproduct offering, their transition finance policies, related  loan origination policies, \nand ESG-related tar gets and limits. Competent authorities shall assess the \nrobustness of those plans as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process.   \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n6 \n \nWhere relevant, for the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph, \ncompetent authorities may cooperate with authorities or public bodies in charge \nof climate change and environmental supervision.  \n7. To foster robust risk management practices and ensure convergence across the Union , the \nEBA has been  empowered in Article 87a (5) of the CRD  to issue guidelines to specify : \na) minimum standards and reference methodologies for the identification,  measurement, \nmanagement and monitoring of ESG risks;  \nb) the content of plans to be prepared in accordance with Article 76 (2) of the CRD, which \nshall include  specific  timelines and intermediate quantifiable targets and milestones, in \norder to monitor and address the financial risks stemming from ESG factors , including \nthose arising from the process of adjustment and transition trends towards the relevant \nMember States and Union  regulatory objectives in relation to ESG factors, in particular \nthe objective to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 as set out in Regulation (EU) \n2021/1119, as well as, where relevant for internationally active institu tions, third -\ncountry legal and regulatory objectives ; \nc) qualitative and quantitative criteria for the assessment of the impact of ESG risks on the \nrisk profile and solvency  of institutions in the short, medium and long term;  \nd) criteria for setting the scenarios referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 87 a of the CRD , \nincluding the parameters and assumptions to be used in each of the scenarios , specific \nrisks  and time horizons . \n8. These guidelines address the aspects included in points a), b) and c ) of the mandate entrusted \nto the EBA. Point  d) of the mandate will be  addressed through the development of \ncomplementary  guidelines  on scenario analysis  related to ESG factors . Therefore,  these \nguidelines on the management of ESG risks only include a broad requirement for institutions \nto perform scenario -based analyses, which will be further specified by th e future guidelines \non scenario analysis.  \n9. These guidelines  aim at  enhancing the identification, measurement, management and \nmonitoring of ESG risks by institutions , as referred to under Article 4(1) point 3 of Regulation \n(EU) No 575/2013 , and at  support ing their safety and soundness as they are confronted with \nthe short -, medium - and long -term impact of ESG factors.  The guidelines contain \nrequirements as to the  internal processes and ESG risk management arrangements that \ninstitutions should have in place , including specific  plans to address the risks arising from the \ntransition and process of adjustment to relevant sustainability legal and regulatory objectives . \n10. The guidelines include minimum reference  methodologies to be  developed and  used by \ninstitutions to assess  ESG risks. Acknowledging the continuous progress in the availability and \ndevelopment of ESG risk data and methodologies, the focus is on the main features of key \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n7 \n \ntypes of methodologies, whilst flexibility is left to institutions regarding specific details, also \nto facilitate the development of institutions’ own methodologies  over time .  \n2.3 Plans to monitor and address ESG risks  \n11. The long -term nature and the profoundness of the transition process towards a climate -\nneutral and sustainable  economy may  entail significant changes in the business models of \ninstitutions  and in the types and levels of risks they are confronted with . As a result, according \nto Article 76 (2) of the CRD, i nstitutions sh all set out specific plans to monitor and address the \nfinancial risks arising  from  ESG factors, including those arising from  the transition and process \nof adjustment to the  relevant Member States and Union regulatory objectives in relation to \nESG factors, as well as, where relevant for international ly active institutions, third -country \nobjectives.   \n12. These guidelines specify requirements for CRD -based plans and are focused on risk -based \ntransition planning from a micro prudential perspective. Their objective is to ensure that \ninstitutions comprehensively assess and embed forward -looking ESG risk considerations in \ntheir strategies, policies and risk management processes, including by taking a long -term \nperspective and with a view to ensuring their soundness and resilience t o the risks faced.  \n13. Whilst based on the prudential framework  for banks , these guidelines and especially Section \n6 and the Annex have been prepared by taking into consideration other initiatives and \nlegislative frameworks related to plans, commonly called transition plans, that should be \ndisclosed and/or developed by sets of non-financial and financial corporates to ensure that \ntheir business model and strategy are compatible with the transition. Th ese include the \nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)1, the Corporate Sustainability Due \nDiligence Directive (CSDDD)2, and the European Commission’s (EC) Recommendation of June \n2023 on facilitating finance for the transition to a sustainable economy3 as well as, where \nrelevant, other international public or private initiatives.  \n14. The requirements related to plans  that are  included under various pieces of EU legislation  \nhave specific but complementary purposes and should be addressed by institutions that are \nin the scope of these requir ements in a coherent and consistent manner. Notably, CSRD and \nCSDDD  include requirements for the disclosure and adoption , respectively,  of plans to ensure  \nthe compatibility of business models of undertakings with the transition to a sustainable \neconomy and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5°C i n line with the Paris Agreement \nand the objective of the EU to achieve  climate neutrality by 2050 . CSRD aims at provi ding \ntransparency to investors and other stakeholders. CRD and these guidelines include \n \n1 Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation \n(EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate \nsustainability reporting.  \n2 Directive (EU) 2024/1760 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 on corporate sustainability \ndue diligence and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937 and Regulation (EU) 2023/2859 . \n3 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2023/1425 of 27 June 2023 on facilitating finance for the transition to a sustainable \neconomy - https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023H1425   \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n8 \n \nrequirements for the monitoring and m anagement  of financial risks stemming from ESG \nfactors, including those arising from the transition towards a climate -neutral and more \nsustainable economy, and therefore have a deeper focus on risk assessment and \nmanagement . Plans required under CRD as specified by these guidelines are not subject to \ndisclosure , although some parts may be covered by transparency requirements of CSRD \nand/or Pillar 3 , but will be assessed by prudential supervisors  of institutions  as part of the \nsupervisory review and evaluation process.  \n15. Whilst these guidelines are focused on the prudential aspects of transition planning, the EBA \nemphasi ses that institutions will need to develop a single, comprehensive strategic planning \nprocess that covers all regulatory requirements stemming from applicable legislation (also \nbeyond the strictly prudential, i.e. including CSRD, CSDDD, sectoral legislation, etc.)  and all \nrelevant aspects , including inter alia  business strategy, risk management, due diligence, and \nsustainability reporting. Such  an integrated , holistic internal  approach should ensure \nconsistent outcomes  when addressing all applicable requirements, the coordination of all \nefforts  related to transition planning within institutions, the operationali sation of strategic \nclimate targets and commitments, a reduced administrative burden , and the development of \nrisk management arrangements commensurate with  the strategies followed by institutions. \nIn particular , an institution that carries out its sustainability reporting in accordance with \nArticles 19a  and 29a of the Accounting Directive4 should ensure consistency of information \nused to comply with the se guidelines and information disclosed  in accordance with the \nEuropean Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and rely on  the already available  \nmaterially identical or significantly comparable relevant information to the extent possible.   \n16. These guidelines do not require CRD -based plans to set out an objective of fully aligning with \nMember States or Union sustainability objectives or one specific transition trajectory.  At the \nsame time, it must be noted  that plans developed by institutions to monitor and address ESG \nrisks in accordance with the CRD also need to consider and ensure consistency with \ninstitutions’ voluntary commitments and other requirements stemming from non -prudential \nregulations. Such consistency is explicitly required under Article 87a(5) subparagraph 2 of the \nCRD which states that, where relevant, the methodologies and assumptions sustaining the \ntargets, the commitments and the strategic decisions disclosed publicly by institutions under \nthe Accounting Directive , or other relevant disclosure and due diligence frameworks, shall be \nconsistent with the criteria, methodologies, assumptions, and targets used in the plans to be \nprepared in accordance with the CRD.  \n17. In addition, while these guidelines do not prescribe any particular business strategy, \ninstitutions need to assess financial risks stemming from misalignments of their portfolios \nwith relevant EU regulatory objectives towards a sustainable economy, including the climate \n \n4 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, \nconsolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n9 \n \ntargets for 2030 and 2050 included in the European Climate Law5, namely  the reduction by \n2030 of greenhouse gas emissions levels by 55% compared to 1990 , and achieving net -zero \nemissions  by 2050 . From a risk management perspective, institutions therefore need to \nunderstand the potential implications for their business models of the transition process and \nof the broader EU legislative framework and develop a strategic response to manage the risks \nassociated with these developments as part of a unified internal transition planning exercise.  \n18. It should also be pointed out  that the goal of CRD-based plans is not to force institutions to \nexit or divest from greenhouse gas -intensive sectors but rather to stimulate institutions to \nproactively reflect on technological, business and behavio ural changes driven by the \ntransition, to thoroughly assess the risks and opportunities they entail, and to prepare or \nadapt accordingly  through structured transition planning , including by engaging with their \nclients and supporting them where appropriate , notwithst anding other mitigation actions \nconsistent with sound risk management .  \n19. Moreover, CRD -based plans are closely related to the policy proposals included in the EBA \nreport on the management and supervision of ESG risks6, which recommended institutions to \nintegrate ESG risks into their processes, including by extending the time horizon for strategic \nplanning to at least 10 years, at least qualitatively, and by testing their resilience to different \nscenarios.   \n20. Against this background, CRD -based  plans  can be understood as the overview and articulation \nof the strategic actions and risk management tools deployed by institutions, based on a \nforward -looking business environment analysis  and a single, compreh ensive transition \nplanning process , to demonstrate how an institution ensures its robustness  and preparedness \nfor the transition to wards  a climate  and environmentally  resilient  and more sustainable \neconomy. These  plans aim at ensuring that institutions identify, me asure, manage and \nmonitor ESG risks, in particular environmental  transition and physical  risks , over several time \nhorizons including long -time horizons  while  also setting targets and milestones at regular time \nintervals. Such plans should be embedded in the institutions’ strategy  and risk management \nand address the risks arising from the structural changes that may occur within the industries \nand counterparties to which institutions are exposed, taking into account  the transition \npathways and adaptation frameworks  compatible with the legal and regulatory objectives of \nthe Member States, EU, and where relevant , other jurisdictions in which they operate.  \n21. These guidelines refer to transition planning as the internal strategic and risk management \nprocess undertaken by institutions to prepare for  risks and potential changes in their business \nmodel associated with a transition to a n environmentally resilient and  more sustainable \neconomy , including the  implement ation of  their objectives and targets for monitor ing and \naddress ing ESG risks . The plans are  in turn  the outputs of the transition planning process.  \n \n5 Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2021 establishing the framework \nfor achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate \nLaw’)  \n6 EBA Report on management and supervision of ESG risks for credit institutions and investment firms  (EBA/REP/2021/18)  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n10 \n \n22. Acknowledging the fast-evolving developments related to  transition plans and the need to \npreserve the responsibility of the management bodies to set the overall business strategies  \nand policies , the se guidelines focus on  processes , principles , core expectations  and main \nfeatures , including metrics , of sound plans  for the management of ESG risks,  while leaving \nflexibility and responsibility to institutions as to the specific details and levels of targets . The \nAnnex provides guidance  on how institutions could  structure the presentation of their plans  \nin line with the requirements established in the guidelines , while not  introducing additional \nrequirements nor  intending to be exhaustive . \n2.4 Proportionality  \n23. The guidelines have been drafted taking into account the proportionality principle set out in \nArticle 87a(2) of the CRD  (see paragraph 6 above) . This means that proportionality should \nfirstly be understood  as driven by  the materiality of ESG risks  associated with the institution ’s \nactivities and business model. As such, t hese guidelines establish in Section 4.1 that \ninstitutions should rely on the results of their materiality assessments of ESG risks to design \nand implement proportionate strategies, policie s, processes and plans .  \n24. In addition, since these guidelines cover internal governance and risk management \narrangement s of institutions , they apply in accordance with the general principle of \nproportionality applicable to internal governance and risk management arrangements  of all \ninstitutions , as laid out in Title I of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance7.   \n25. The size of institutions is not a sufficient criterion to apply proportionality with regard to the \nmanagement of ESG risks. S maller institutions are not immune to ESG risks, for example in \ncase of  concentrations of exposures in ESG -sensitive economic sectors or in geographical \nareas prone to physical risks. All institutions should therefore implement approaches that are \ncommensurate with  the results of their  materiality assessment  and that ensure their ability \nto manage ESG risks in a safe and prudent manne r.  \n26. However, the size and complexity of institutions do play a role in the level of available \nresources  and capacities  to manage  ESG risks . These guidelines therefore provide some \ndifferentiated provisions  for small and non -complex institutions (SNCI s) as well as for other \nnon-large institutions , where appropriate,  allowing them to implement less complex or \nsophisticated arrangements . On the other hand , these guidelines include  some more \nextensive  requirements for large institutions8.  \n27. Concretely, t he specific provisions included in these guidelines for SNCIs and other non -large  \ninstitutions  relate to the frequency of updates of the materiality assessment  (see paragraph \n11 of the guidelines) , the extent to which  qualitative considerations and/or estimates and \nproxies  can be used  (see e.g., paragraph 15 of the guidelines) , the number and granularity of \nrisk assessment methodologies (see section 4.2.3 ) and moni toring metrics  (see paragraph 81) \n \n7 EBA Guidelines on internal governance under Directive 2013/36/EU (EBA/GL/2021/05)  \n8 Definitions of SNCI and large institution provided in Article 4(1) (145) and Article 4(1)(146)  of the CRR , respectively, apply.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n11 \n \nas well as certain aspects of CRD -based plans  such as their granularity  (paragraph 110) , update \nfrequency  (paragraph 114) , scenarios  (paragraph 97) and metrics  (paragraph 106) . \n28. With regard to CRD -based plans, Article 76(2) of the CRD  allows Member States to indicate  in \nwhat areas a waiver or a simplified procedure may be applied  by SNCI s. Section 6 of these \nguidelines already provide s proportionality measures for SNCI s and other non -large \ninstitutions which apply even  in cases where  Member States do not make use of th e \nmentioned  CRD provision . If a Member State decide s to apply the provision , Section 6 of these \nguidelines will apply to SNCI s dependent on the transposition of CRD into national law.  \n2.5 Environmental risks and ESG risks   \n29. As reflected in the CRD provisions , and in line with the sequenced approach adopted under \nother EBA regulatory products  on ESG risks such as  the Implementing Technical Standards on \nPillar 3 disclosures , the se guidelines put emphasis on environmental risks while still containing \nsome minimum requirements on the remaining categories  of ESG risks.    \n30. Although currently  institutions are typically more advanced as regards  the measurement and \nassessment of climate -related risks, it is important that institutions progressively develop \ntools and practices that aim at assessing and managing the impact s of a sufficiently \ncomprehensive range  of environmental risks, as defined in Article 4(1)(52e) of the CRR, \nextending beyond merely climate -related risks to also include  broader environmental risks  \nsuch as risks stemming from the degradation  of ecosystems  and biodiversity loss, as well as \nfrom  other ESG factors9. Given the widespread dependence of economic activit ies on nature , \nit is particularly relevant that institutions properly understand the potential  physical and \ntransition risks that could result from nature  degradation  and from  actions aimed at \nprotecting and restoring it . \n31. In addition, it should be kept in mind that in stitutions can be both impacted by (so -called \n‘financial materiality’) and have an impact on (so -called ‘environmental and social \nmateriality’) environmental and social factors  through their core business activities, i.e. their \nlending to counterparties and their investments in assets. On the financial materiality side, \nthe economic and financial activities of counterparties or invested assets can be negatively \nimpacted by environmental or social factors, which might affect the value  and risk profile  of \nsuch activities and  in turn  translate into a financial impact on the institution. On the \nenvironmental and social materiality side, the economic and financial activities of \ncounterparties or invested assets can have a negative impact on environmental and social \nfactors, which could i n turn translate into a direct  financial impact on the institution  or affect \nit through reputational, litigation or business model risk s. The assessment and management \nof environmental and social risks should take both of these dimensions into account to the \nextent that they affect the financial risks  to which  institutions are exposed.  \n \n9 Annex 1 of EBA Report on management and supervision of ESG risks provides a non -exhaustive list of ESG factors \n(EBA/REP/2021/18)  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n12 \n \n2.6 Articulation with international developments and other EBA \nproducts  \n32. These guidelines build on existing EU and international requirements and/or principles on the \nmanagement of ESG risks, such as the BCBS principles for the effective management and \nsupervision of climate -related financial risks10. They also take into account  the analysis \nperformed and recommendations included in the EBA Report on the management and \nsupervision  of ESG risks , guidance published by supervisors or networks of central banks  such \nas the Network for Greening the Financial System  (NGFS) , various initiatives related to \ntransition planning and plans11 as well as supervisory experience regarding  institutions’ \npractices on the management of climate and environmental risks.   \n33. These guidelines are consistent with and include cross -references to other EBA guidelines  or \nstandards  which refer to ESG risks, such as the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and \nmonitoring  (with respect to integration of ESG risks in credit risk policies ), the EBA Guidelines \non internal governance  (with respect to integration of ESG risks in governance arrangements ), \nand the EBA Implementing Technical Standards on Pillar 3 disclosure of ESG risks  (with respect \nto ESG risk metrics ). In addition, based on t he recent amendments to the CRD, the EBA will \nintroduce or incorporate further ESG risk considerations when developing future  guidelines \non scenario analysis and when updating its  guidelines on internal governance , guidelines on \nfit-and-proper assessments  and guidelines on remuneration policies . These future \ndevelopments and  updates will be done in a way that  ensur es consistency with these  \nguidelines on the management of ESG risks , complementing them in specific areas  such as \nscenario analysis,  the responsibilities of the management body or the integration of ESG risks \ninto institutio ns’ remuneration frameworks . \n34. These guidelines are part of the EBA’s mandates and tasks in the area of sustainable finance \nand ESG risks  which cover the three pillars of the prudential  framework  for banks as well as \nother areas related to sustainable finance and the assessment and monitoring of ESG risks , as \nlaid out in the EBA’s roadmap on sustainable finance12.  \n  \n \n10 BCBS Principles for the effective management and supervision of climate -related financial risks \nhttps://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d532.htm   \n11 Non-exhaustive examples include publications by the NGFS, EU Platform on Sustainable Finance, UK Transition Plan \nTaskforce, Taskforce on Nature -related Financial Disclosures . \n12 EBA roadmap on sustainable finance  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n13 \n \n3.

As part of th e reference methodolo gy for institutions’ identification and measurement of ESG \nrisks to be included in their strategies and internal procedures , institutions  should provide for \nthe regular  perform ance of  a materiality assessment of ESG risks.  That assessment should be \nperformed at least every year or, for  small and non -complex institutions  (SNCI s), every two \nyears . Institutions including SNCI s should , how ever , update their assessment  more frequently \nin case of a material change  to their business environment  related  to ESG factors , such as \nsignificant new public policies or shifts in the institution’s business model, portfolios or oper-\nations .  \n12. The materiality assessment of ESG risks should be performed as  an institution -specific assess-\nment which provide s the institution with a view on the financial materiality of ESG risks for its \nbusiness model and risk profile , supported by  a mapping of ESG factors and transmission \nchannels to traditional financial risk  categorie s. The materiality assessment  of ESG risks  should  \nbe consistent with  other materiality assessment s conducted  by the institution , in particular  \nthose made  for the purpose of disclosing material sustainability risks in accordance with  Di-\nrective 2013/34/EU6 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/27727, where applica-\nble, and should be integrated into the internal capital adequacy assessment process ( ICAAP ) \nmateriality assessment.   \n13. The materiality assessment of ESG risks should use a risk -based approach that takes into ac-\ncount the likelihood of occurrence and the potential magnitude of the financial effects of ESG \nrisks  in the short  and medium term and over a long -term  horizon of at least 10 years .  \n14. With a view to comprehensively assessing the materiality  of ESG risks,  institutions should \nensure that the scope of their materiality assessment sufficiently reflects the nature, size and \ncomplexity of their activit ies, portfolios, services , and products.  Institutions  should consider \nthe impact of ESG risks on all traditional financial risk categories to which they  are exposed, \nincluding credit, market, liquidity, operational  (including litigation) , reputational, business \nmodel and concentration risks. The determination of material ESG risks should consider both \n \n6 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, \nconsolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC \nof the European Par liament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, \n29/06/2013, p. 19).  \n7 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 of 31 July 2023 supplementing Directive 2013/34/EU of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council as regards sustainability reporting standards  (OJ L, 2023/2772, 22.12.2023).  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n19 \n \ntheir impacts on financial risk categories and the amounts and/or shares of exposures , \nrevenues and profits exposed to the risks.  \n15. With regard to the materiality assessment of environmental risks , institutions should use both \nqualitative and quantitative information . Institutions should consider a s ufficiently large \nscope of envi ronmental factors that includes at least climate -related factors, degradation  of \necosystem s and biodiversity loss . Institutions should asses s both transition and physical risk \ndrivers , taking into account at least  the following:  \na) For transition risks :  \ni. the main economic sectors that the financed assets support or in which  the \ninstitution’s counterparty has its principal activit ies; \nii. ongoing and potential future material changes in public policies, technologies \nand market preferences  (e.g. new  environmental regulations  or tax incen-\ntives, development of innovative low-carbon  technologies, shifts in  consumer  \nor investor  demand) ; \niii. with respect to climate -related risks : \n1. exposures towards sectors that contribute  highly  to climate change \nas specified in Recital 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) \n2020/1818 i.e. the sectors listed in Sections A to H and Section L of \nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/20068, with particular \nconsideration given to  exposures towards  fossil fuel sector entities ;  \n2. the degree of alignment or misalignment of portfolios with the \nrelevant regulatory  objectives of the jurisdictions where they operate  \n– for SNCIs  and other non -large institutions  at least on the basis of a \nhigh -level qualitative assessment ; \nb) For physical risks : \ni. the geographical areas in which key assets of counterparties  (e.g. production \nsites)  and, in particular for real estate exposures, physical collateral is located;  \nii. the vulnerability level to environmental hazards (e.g. temperature -related , \nwind -related , water -related , solid mass -related hazards ) associated with dif-\nferent climate scenarios and transition pathways  or, for SNCIs  and other non -\nlarge institutions , associated with at least one adverse scenario . \n \n8 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 of 17 July 2020 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council as regards minimum standards for EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU \nParis -aligned Benchmarks (OJ L 406, 03/12/2020, p. 17 ) - Climate Benchmark Standards Regulation - Recital 6: Sectors \nlisted in Sections A to H and Section L of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n20 \n \n \n16. Institutions should substantiate and document as part of their ICAAP their materiality \nassessments  of ESG risks , including methodologies and thresholds used, inputs and factors \nconsidered and main results and conclusions  reached , including non -materiality conclusions.  \n \n17. Institutions should develop and implement measurement methods , risk management \narrangements and transition planning processes , respectively in accordance with  Section  4.2, \nSection 5 , and Section 6,  that are commensurate with and informed by the  outcomes of the \nmateriality assessment . To this end, institutions should have more extensive and \nsophisticated arrangements  for ESG risks identified as material . In turn , the ESG risk \nmeasurement methodologies and ESG risk monitoring metrics used by institutions should \nsupport and inform  the regular  updates of the materiality assessment.  Smaller institutions  \nwith less complex activities may apply less extensive and sophisticated arrangements , which \nhowever should be commensurate with the results of the ir materiality assessment of ESG \nrisks.  \n4.2 Identification and measurement of ESG risks  \n 4.2.1 General  principles   \n18. As part of the minimum standards to  identify and measure ESG risks , institutions’ internal \nprocedures should include tools  and methodologies to  assess  ESG risk drivers and their trans-\nmission channels into the different  prudential risk categories  and financial risk metrics affect-\ning the institution’s exposures , including with a forward -looking perspective.  \n19. To ensure a proper identification  and management of ESG risks, i nstitutions should consider \nthe potential impact of these risks in the short , medium and long term. The level of granularity \nand accuracy of data points, quantification tools , methods  and indicators used by institutions \nshould take into account their  materiality assessment and their  size and complexity and gen-\nerally  be higher for the short and medium term. Long-term time horizons should  at least  be \nconsidered from a qualitative perspective and support strategic assessments  and decision -\nmaking . \n20. With regard to environmental risks, internal procedures and methodologies  should  allow in-\nstitutions to :  \na. quantif y climate -related  risks, such as by estimating the probabilities of materiali sa-\ntion and magnitude of financial impacts stemming from climate -related factors;  \nb. properly understand the financial risks that may result from other types of environ-\nmental risks, such as  those stemming from the degradation of nature, including  bio-\ndiversity  loss and the loss of ecosystem services , or the misalignment of activities  with \nactions aimed at protecting, restoring, and/or reducing negative impacts  on nature ; \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n21 \n \nc. establish key risk indicators (KRIs) covering at least  short - and medium -term time ho-\nrizons and a scope of exposures and portfolios determined in line with the results of \nthe materiality assessment . \n21. With regard to social and governance risks,  where quantitative information is initially lacking, \ninstitutions’ internal procedures should provide for method s that start by evaluating qualita-\ntively the potential impacts of these risks on the operations of, and financial risks faced by, \nthe institution, and should progressively  develop more advanced qualitative and quantitative \nmeasures . Institutions should gradually enhance their approaches in line with regulatory, sci-\nentific , data availabil ity and methodolo gical progress . \n22. With regard to the interactions between the different categories of , respectively,  environ-\nmental, social and governance risks, institutions ’ internal procedures should ensure that  each \ncategory of risk is first assessed  taking into account its specific characteristics, before consid-\nering potential inter connections  and interdepe ndencies  in the measurement of these risks . \n 4.2.2 Data processes  \n23. Institutions ’ internal procedures  should  provide for the  implementation of  sound  information \nmanagement  systems to identif y, collect , structur e and analys e the data  that is necessary to \nsupport the assessment , management and monitoring  of ESG risks . Such systems should be \nimplemented across the institution as part of the overall data governance and IT infrastruc-\nture . Institutions should regularly  review their practices to ensur e they remain up to date  with  \npublic  (e.g. increased data availability due to regulatory  initiatives ) and market developments  \nand should have in place arrangements to assess and improve data  quality.  \n24. Institutions ’ internal procedures  should  ensure that institutions  gather  and use the  infor-\nmation needed to assess , manage , and monitor  the current and forward -looking ESG  risks \nthey may be exposed to via their  counterparties, by aiming at collecting client - and asset -level \ndata  at an appropriate ly granular level . \n25. Institutions ’ internal procedures  shoul d build on both internally and externally available ESG \ndata, including by regularly reviewing and making use of sustainability information disclosed \nby their counterparties , in particular  in accordance with  European Sustainability  Reporting \nStandards  developed under the Directive 2013/34/EU  or voluntary reporting standard for \nnon-listed Small and Medium -size Enterprises (SME s) as per the Communication COM  (2023) \n535 on the S ME relief package9. \n26. Institutions  should assess which other sources of data would effectively support the \nassessment , management and monitoring  of ESG risks, such as  information obtained  through \nengagement with clients and counterparties as part of new and existing business \nrelationships , or third -party data . When institutions use services of third -party providers to \n \n9 COM  (2023) 535 - Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European \nEconomic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - SME Relief Package  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n22 \n \ngain access to ESG data, institutions should ensure they have a sufficient understanding of the \nsources, data and methodologies used by data providers , including their potential limitations . \n27. Where the quality or availability of data is initially not sufficient to meet  risk management \nneeds, institutions should assess these gaps and their potential impacts. Institutions should \ntake and document remediating actions, including  the use of estimates or proxies , e.g. based \non sector al- and/or region al-level characteristics and, when feasible, making  adjustments to \naccount for counterparty -specific aspects . Institutions should seek to reduce the use of \nestimates and proxies over time as ESG data availability and quality improve . \n28. For large c orporate c ounterparties  as defined by Article 3(4) of Directive 2013/34/EU , \ninstitutions should consider collecting or obtaining the foll owing  data points , where \napplicable : \na. For environmental risks:  \ni. geographical location of key assets (e.g. production sites) and exposure to \nenvironmental hazards  (e.g. temperature -related , wind -related , water -related , solid \nmass -related hazards ) at the level of granularity needed for appropriate physical risk \nanalysis, and availability of insurance ;  \nii. current and , if a vailable , targeted  green house  gas (GHG)  scope 1, 2 and 3  emissions  in \nabsolute value and, where relevant, in intensity value ; \niii. dependency  on fossil fuels, either in terms of economic factor inputs or revenue base ; \niv. energy and water  demand and/or  consumption, either in terms of economic factor \ninputs or revenue base ; \nv. level of energy efficiency  for real estate exposures  and the debt servic ing capacity of \nthe counterparty ;  \nvi. the current and anticipated financial effects of environmental  risks and opportunities \non the counterparty’s  financial position, financial performance and cash flows ; \nvii. transition -related  strategic plans , including transition plan  for climate change \nmitigation  disclosed  in accordance with Article 19a or Article 29a of Directive (EU) \n2022/2464 , when available ; \nb. For social and governance risks:  \ni. alignment with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises , UN Guiding \nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights  and International Labour Organisation  \nDeclaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work ; \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n23 \n \nii. negative material impacts on own workers, workers in the value chain, affected \ncommunities and consumers/end -users including information on due diligence efforts  \nor processes  to avoid and remediate  such impacts . \n29. For exposures towards other types of counterparties than large corporates , institutions \nshould : \na. determin e the data points needed for the identification , measurement and \nmanagement of ESG risks , considering  the list provided in paragraph 28 to support \nthat assessment ; \nb. where needed  to address data gaps , use expert judgment , qualitative data , \nportfolio -level assessments and proxies in line with paragraph 2 7.  \n \n4.2.3 Main features of reference methodologies for the identification and \nmeasurement of ESG risks  \n30. Institutions’ internal procedures should provide for a combination of risk assessment \nmethodologies, including exposure -based, sector -based , portfoli o-based, and scenario -based \nmethodologies, as set out in paragraphs 3 1 to 42. The combination of methodologies should \nbe put together in a way that allows institutions to comprehensively assess ESG risks over all \nrelevant  time horizons. In particular, institutions should at least use exposure -based  method s \nto obtain a short -term view of how ESG risks are impact ing the risk profile and the profitability \nof their counterparties, use sector -based, portfolio -based and scenario -based methods to \nsupport the medium -term planning process and the definition of risk limits and risk appetite \nfor steering the institution towards its strategic objectives, and assess through scenario -based \nmethods their sensitivities to ESG risks across different time horizons including long -term \nones .  \na. Exposure -based  methods  \n31. At an exposure -based level, in line with  the provisions in  paragraphs 126 and 146 of the EBA \nGuidelines on loan origination and monitoring, institutions should  have internal procedures  \nin place to  assess the exposure of their counterparties’ activities and key assets to ESG factors, \nin particular environmental factors and the impact of climate change, and the \nappropriateness of the mitigating actions. To this end, institutions should ensure that ESG \nfactors , in particular environmental factors,  are properly  reflected in their internal risk \nclassification procedures , are taken into account in the overall assessment of default risk of a \nborrower and, where justified  by their materiality , are embedded in to the risk indicators, \ninternal credit scoring or rating models, as well as into the valuation of collateral.   \n32. With regard to  the assessment of environmental risks at exposure level, institutions ’ internal \nprocedures  should include  a set of risk factors and criteria that capture both physical and \ntransition risk drivers . For large institutions, this  includ es, where applicable, at least the \nfollowing:  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n24 \n \na) the degree of vulnerability to environmental hazards , taking into account the \ngeographical location of the key assets of counterparties and guarantors , or of the \nphysical collateral backing the exposures, considering both on -balance sheet and off -\nbalance sheet exposures;  \nb) the degree of vulnerability to transition risks, taking into account  relevan t technological \ndevelopments , the impact of applicable or forthcoming  environmental regulation s \naffecting  the sector of activity of the counterparty , the current and  if any  targeted GHG \nemissions  in absolute and, where relevant , intensity  value  of the counterparty , the \nimpact of evolving market preferences, and the level of energy efficiency  in the case of \nresidential or commercial real estate exposures  together with the debt service capacity \nof counterparties ; \nc) the exposure of the counterparty’s  business model and/or supply chain to critical \ndisruptions due to environmental factors  such as  the impact of biodiversity loss, water \nstress or pollution ; \nd) the exposure of the counterparty to  reputational and  litigation risk s taking into account  \ncompleted, pending or imminent  litigation case s related to environmental issues ;  \ne) the (planned) maturity  or term structure of the exposure  or asset;  \nf) risk-mitigating factors , such as  private or public  insurance coverage , for example based \non applicable  national catastrophe schemes or similar frameworks , and the capacity of \nthe counterparty to ensure resilience  to transition and physical risks including through \nforward -looking  transition plan ning . \n33. Where data needed to assess certain criteria is not yet available, such as for smaller corporate \ncounterparties, institutions should follow the steps outlined in pa ragraph s 26, 27 and 29.   \n34. With regard to the assessment of social and governance risks at exposure level, institutions \nshould implement due diligence processes with a view to assessing the financial impacts \nstemming from , and the vulnerability of counterparties’ business model to , social and \ngovernance factors , taking into account  the adherence of corporate counterparties to social \nand governance standards  such as those mentioned in paragraph 28 b(i), the exposure of the \ncounterparty to litigation risk  driven by social or governance issues , as well as  the applicable \nlegislation in the jurisdiction where the counterparty operates.  \nb. Sector -based , portfolio -based and portfolio alignment  methods  \n35. Institutions ’ internal procedures  should  provide for  sector -based and portfolio -based  \nmethodologies , in particular heat maps that highlight ESG risks of individual economic (sub -) \nsectors in a chart or on a scaling system  as referred to in paragraphs 127 and 149 of the EBA \nGuidelines on loan origination and monitoring.  Institutions’ methodologies should allow to \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n25 \n \nmap their portfolios according to ESG risk drivers and identify any concentration towards one \nor more type(s) of ESG risks . \n36. With regard to non -climate related ESG factors,  large institutions should develop:  \na) methods to identify  sectors that are highly dependent on , or have significant impact \non, ecosystem services , and tools to measure  the financial impact of nature \ndegradation and actions aimed at protecting, restoring and/or reducing negative \nimpacts on nature ; \nb) approaches to measuring the  positive or adverse  impact s of their portfolios on the \nachievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals  and evaluating  potential \nrelated financial risks.  \n37. With regard to climate -related risks, institutions’ internal procedures should provide for the \nuse of at least one portfolio alignment methodology  to assess on a sectoral basis the degree \nof alignment of institution’s portfolios with climate -related pathways and /or benchmark \nscenarios . Institutions should also consider assessing the alignment at counterparty level  e.g. \nby comparing the  GHG  emissions intensity of a given counterparty with an applicable sectoral \nbenchmark . \n38. For the purposes of paragraph 37, institutions should use scenarios that are science -based , \nrelevant  to sectors of economic activity and the geographical location of their exposures , up \nto date  and originating from national, EU or international organisations such as national \nenvironmental agencies,  Joint Research Center of the EU Commission , the International \nEnergy Agency , Network for Gr eening the Financial System, International Panel on Climate \nChange . Sectoral decarboni sation pathways should be consistent with the applicable  policy \nobjective , such as the EU objective to reach net -zero GHG emissions by 2050  and to reduc e \nemissions by 55%  by 2030  compared to  the 1990 level , or any national objective where \napplicable . \n39. For the purposes of paragraph 37, institutions should determine the appropriate scope of the  \nportfolio alignment  assessment s and the degree of sophistication of the methodologies used \nbased on  the characteristics of their portfolios , the results of  their materiality assessment  and \ntheir size and complexity . Large institutions  with securities traded on a regulated market \nwithin  the Union  should take into account the list of sectors included  in Template 3 of Annex \nI of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/245310. SNCIs and other non -large \ninstitutions may use representative samples of exposures in their portfolios to undertake  \nportfolio alignment  assessments.  \n \n10 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 of 30 November 2022 amending the implementing technical \nstandards laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/637 as regards the disclosure of environmental, social and \ngovernance risks  (OJ L 324, 19.12.2022, p. 1).  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n26 \n \n40. Institutions should justify and document their methodological choices including the choice of \nscenario (s) and the base year, the selection of sectors and , for SNCI s and other non -large \ninstitutions , the identification of a representative sample of exposures , as well as any \nsigni ficant  methodological change  over time . When data needed to measure alignment  is \nmissing, institutions should follow the steps set out in paragraphs 2 6, 27 and 29. \n41. Institutions should consider insights gained from climate portfolio alignment methodologies \nto: \na. assess and monitor  climate -related transition risks stemming from misalignments of \ncounterparties and/or portfolios  with EU, Member State or third -country  regulatory \nobjectives and pathways consistent with applicable  climate goals, and potential \nrelated financial risks;  \nb. inform their decision -making process on the formulation and implementation of their \nrisk appetite, business strategy  and transition planning including regarding \nprioriti sation of  engagement with certain  counterparties.  \nc. Scenario -based  methods  \n42. In addition to exposure -based, sector -based, portfolio -based and portfolio alignment \nmethods, i nstitutions’ internal procedures should provide for the use  of scenario -based  \nanalyses  to test their resilience to ESG risks, starting with climate -related risks , under various \nscenarios11.  \n \n11 Point d ) of the mandate included in Article 87a(5) of Directive 2013/36/EU  will be addressed through the development \nof complementary EBA Guidelines on scenario analysis  to test the resilience of institutions to environmental, social and \ngovernance factors . \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n27 \n \n5. Minimum standards and reference \nmethodology for the m anagement and \nmonitoring of ESG risks  \n5.1 ESG risk management principles  \n43. For the purposes of  integrating ESG risks in to the institution -wide risk management frame-\nwork in accordance with paragraph 152 of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance, insti-\ntutions should consider the role of ESG risks as potential drivers of all traditional categories \nof financial risks, including credit, market, operational  (including litigation) , reputational, li-\nquidity, business model, and concentration risks.  \n44. Institutions should embed ESG risks within their regular risk management systems and pro-\ncesses ensuring  consistency  with their overall business and risk strategies, including plans  in \naccordance with Article 76(2) of Directive 2013/36 /EU as fu rther specified in  Section 6. Insti-\ntutions should ensure that they have  a fully integrated approach where ESG risks are properly \ncaptured and considered as part of risk management strategies, policies and limits. Where \ninstitutions have in place specific arrangements for ESG risks, they should ensure this is re-\nflected in, and feeds into , the regular risk management framework.  \n45. Institutions should develop a robust and sound approach to managing and mitigating ESG \nrisks over the short  and medium term and over a long -term  horizon of at least 10 years , taking \ninto account the principle s outlined in paragraph 19. \n46. Institutions should determine which combination of risk management and mitigation tools \nwould best contribute to this, by considering a range of tools,  including the following : \na) engagement with counterparties aim ing at better understanding the risk profile of the \ncounterparty  and at ensuring consistency with  the institution’s  risk appetite  and stra-\ntegic objectives , in particular  by: \ni. determining the scope of counterparties with whom to engage , taking into \naccount the outcomes of the materiality assessment and of the risk measure-\nment process ; \nii. establishing a dialogue with those counterparties  to review their resilience \ntowards ESG risks, taking into acco unt the sectoral legislation that affects \nthose counterparties and any transition plan  they have developed ; \niii. where relevant and possible, providing relevant information and advice to \nclients  on the assessment or mitigation of ESG risks they are exposed to ; and \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n28 \n \niv. considering a range of counterparty -specific actions, such as adjustment to \nproduct offering, agreement on a plan  and remedial actions to support  tran-\nsition efforts and  an enhanced resilience of  the counterparty, or as a last re-\nsort cessation of the relationship when continuation is considered incompat-\nible with the institution’s planning and risk appetite . \nb) adjusting financial terms (e.g. including contractually -agreed safeguards and correc-\ntive measures), conditions (e.g. tenor) and /or pricing based on ESG risk -relevant cri-\nteria  and the institution’s risk strategy and internal capital policy;  \nc) considering  ESG risks when developing sectoral policies and when setting  global, re-\ngional  and sectoral risk limits, exposure limits and deleveraging strategies;  \nd) diversification of lending and investment portfolios based on ESG  risk-relevant crite-\nria, e.g. in terms of economic sectors or geographical areas ; \ne) other risk management tools deemed appropriate in line with the institution’s risk \nappetite , such as a possible reallocation of financing between and within sectors to-\nwards exposures more resilient to  ESG risk s. \n5.2 Strategies and business models  \n47. Institutions should account for ESG risks when developing  and implementing their overall \nbusiness and risk strategies, which should includ e at least : \na) understanding and assessing the business environment in which they operate, and \nhow they are exposed to structural changes in the economy, financial system, and \ncompetitive landscape over the short, medium and long  term as a result of ESG fac-\ntors; \nb) understanding and assessing how ESG risks, in  particular environmental risk drivers \nincluding  transition and physical risks, can have an adverse impact on the  viability of \ntheir business model and sustainability of their business strategy , including  profitabil-\nity and revenue sources, over the short, medium and long  term;  \nc) considering how these ESG risks , in particular  environmental risk drivers including  \ntransition and physical risks, may affect their ability to achieve their strategic objec-\ntives and remain within their risk appetite;  \nd) formulating , implementing  and monitoring plans and targets as set out in Section 6 .  \n48. For the purposes of paragraph 4 7 and with a view to ensuring sufficiently informed strategies, \ninstitutions should consider insights gained from  a combination of forward -looking risk as-\nsessment methods, including : \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n29 \n \na) portfolio alignment methodologies , as described in Section 4.2; \nb) environmental risk scenario analyses , taking into account  the (potential) business en-\nvironment(s) in which they might be operating in the short, medium and long  term , \nincluding a time horizon of at least 10 years ; \nc) climate  or environmental st ress tests  performed by the institution . \n49. Institutions should have a comprehensive understanding of their business model, strategic \nobjectives and risk strategy from an ESG risk perspective and should ensure that their govern-\nance , transition plan ning process  and risk management framework, including risk appetite, \nare adequate to implement them.  \n5.3 Risk appetite  \n50. Institutions should ensure that their risk appetite clearly defines and addresses ESG risks  \nwhich are part of their risk inventory  following the materiality assessment . The risk appetite \nshould specify the level and type s of ESG risks  institutions are willing to assume  in the ir port-\nfolio , including as regards the portfolio’s concentration and diversification objective s. The in-\ntegration of ESG risks in the risk appetite  should be consistent with the institution’s strategic \nobjectives and commitments and with  the plans  and targets specified under Section 6.   \n51. The risk appetite should be implemented with the support of ESG -related KRIs , including  e.g. \npotential limits, thresholds or exclusions . For the determination of relevant and  appropriate  \nKRIs , institutions should consider  the results of their materiality assessment and  the specific \nfeatures of  their business model , taking into account  relevant business lines, activitie s, prod-\nucts, and exposures towards  economic sectors  and geographies , including jurisdictions and \nmore granular  geographical  areas . Institutions should consider  the metrics listed in Section \n5.7 when determining which selected  KRIs  to use in the ir risk appetite  framework . \n52. Institutions should ensure that all relevant group entities and business lines and units bearing \nrisk properly understand and implement the institution’s risk appetite  in terms of ESG risks . \nIn particular in large institutions r isk limits should be set a t different  level s within the institu-\ntion, ensuring  consistency with the overall risk appetite , and should anchor ESG risk  consid-\nerations in relation to the products or financial instruments issued, or iginated or held by the \ninstitution, client segments, type of collateral and risk mitigation instruments . \n53. The institution’s risk appetite and associated KRIs  should be subject to monitoring and esca-\nlation processes as set out in paragraph 80. \n5.4 Internal culture, capabilities and controls  \n54. Institutions should develop on an ongoing basis their capabilities to identify, assess , monitor , \nmanage and mitigate  ESG risks  as appropriate . Institutions should ensure, as part of their \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n30 \n \ntraining policy, that their management body and staff are adequately trained to understand \nthe implications of ESG factors and ESG risks with a view to fulfilling their responsibilities ef-\nfectively. The policies and procedures on training  activities  should be kept up  to date and take \ninto account scientific and regulatory developments; the procedure for managers should take \ninto account that knowledge of ESG factors and ESG risks is relevant for the assessment of the \nsuitability of members of the management  body and for key function holders in line with the \nJoint EBA and ESMA Guidelines on suitability assessments12. \n55. The sound and consistent risk culture that accounts for ESG risks implemented within the \ninstitution in accordance with Title IV of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance13 should  \ninclude clear communication from the management body (‘tone from the top’) and appropri-\nate measures to promote knowledge of ESG  factors and  ESG risks  across the institution , as \nwell as awareness of the institution’s ESG strategic objectives and commitments.  \n56. For the purposes of Title V of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance14, institutions should \nincorporate ESG risks into their internal control frameworks across the three lines of defence . \nThe internal control framework should include a clear definition and assignment of ESG risk \nresponsibilities and reporting lines.  \n57. The first line of defen ce should be responsible for undertaking assessments of ESG risks, tak-\ning into account materiality and proportionality considerations, during the client onboarding, \ncredit application , credit review and, where relevant, investing processes, and in ongoing \nmonitoring and engagement with existing  clients . Staff in the first line of defence  should have \nan adequate understanding and knowledge to be able to  identify potential ESG risks.  \n58. As part of the activities of the second line of defence :  \na) the risk management function should be responsible for undertaking ESG risk assess-\nment and monitoring independently from the first line of defence , including by en-\nsuring adherence to the risk limits , questioning and where necessary  challenging the \ninitial assessment conducted by the business relationship officers ; \nb) the compliance function should oversee how the first line of defence  ensure s adher-\nence to applicable ESG risk legal requirements and internal policies , and should advise \nthe management body and other relevant staff on measures to be taken to ensure \nsuch compliance. In addition, in relation to the sustainability claims and/or commit-\nments made by the institution, it should provide advice on the reputational and con-\nduct risks associated with the implementation or failure to implement such claims \nand/or commitments ; \n \n12 Joint ESMA and EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key \nfunction holders under Directive 2013/36/EU and Directive 2014/65/EU (EBA/GL/2021/06)  \n13 Title IV – Risk culture and business conduct  \n14 Title V – Internal control framework and mechanisms  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n31 \n \nc) the compliance function and the risk management function should be consulted for \nthe approval of new products with ESG features or for significant changes to existing \nproducts to embed ESG aspects.  \n59. As third line of defence , the internal audit function (IAF) should provide an independent re-\nview and objective assurance of the quality and effectiveness of the overall internal control \nframework and systems in relation to ESG risks, including the first and second lines of defence  \nand the ESG risk governance framework.  \n5.5 Internal capital adequacy assessment  process  and internal \nliquidity adequacy assessment process  \n60. Institutions should incorporate material  ESG risks and their impacts on financial risk catego-\nries into their ICAAP to assess , and maintain on an ongoing basis , the amounts, types and \ndistribution of internal capital that they consider adequate to cover the nature and level of \nESG risks , taking into account the short, medium and long term.  \n61. When institutions take into account longer time horizons  for the coverage of ESG risks , these \ntime horizons should be used as a source of information to ensure a sufficient understanding \nof the potential implications of ESG risks for capital  planning  within  the regular ICAAP time \nhorizons . The time horizons  considered for the determination of adequate internal capital to \ncover ESG risks should be consistent with  the time horizons  used as part of the institutions’ \noverall  ICAAP . The ICAAP shoul d be suffi ciently forward -looking  and where an institution as-\nsesses that risks should not be covered by capital but be mitigated through other tools or \nactions , it should be e xplained.  \n62. Institutions should use insights gained from  their risk assessment methodologies, including \nthose referred to  in Section 4.2, to identify and measure internal capital needs for exposures \nor portfolios assessed as more vulnerable to ESG risks , taking into account the differing levels \nof availability and maturity of quantification methodologies for environmental risks compared \nto social and governance risks.  \n63. With regard to environmental risks, institutions should include in their ICAAP  a forward -look-\ning view of their capital adequacy under  an adverse scenario  that includes specific environ-\nmental risks  elements . In addition, institutions should specify any changes to the institution’s \nbusiness plan or other measures  derived from climate  or environmental  risks stress testing \nand/or reverse stress testing, in line with paragraph 90 of EBA Stress Testing Guidelines15.  \n64. Institutions should incorporate material environmental risks and their impacts on liquidity in \ntheir internal liquidity adequacy assessment process ( ILAAP ) over appropriate time horizon s \nwithin the scope of the ILAAP coverage . \n \n15 EBA Guidelines on institutions stress testing (EBA/GL/2018/04)  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n32 \n \n65. Institutions should include in their ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks a description of the risk ap-\npetite, thresholds and limits set for , respectively,  material ESG risks  and material environmen-\ntal risks  and their impacts on their solvency or liquidity , as well as the process applied to keep-\ning these thresholds and limits up to date. Institutions should provide sufficient contextual \ninformation to understand their analysis of the capital and liquidity implications of , respec-\ntively, ESG and  environmental risks, inc luding by providing clarity on the methodologies used \nand underlying assumptions.  \n66. When integrating ESG risks in to their ICAAP and environmental risks in their ILAAP, the com-\nplexity of the processes and the degree of sophistication of the methodologies used by insti-\ntutions should take into account their size and complexity  and the results of the ir materiality \nassessment . \n5.6 Policies and procedures  for financial risk  categories  \n67. Institutions should understand and manage the current and potential future impact of ESG \nrisks on their exposures to credit risk, on the valuation of their positions subject to market \nrisk, in particular for prudent valuation purposes, on their liquidity risk profile and buffers, on \ntheir operational (including li tigation ) risks, and on reputational risks, including through the \nuse of forward -looking analyses.  \n5.6.1  Credit risk  \n68. For the purposes of integrating ESG risks in to credit risk policies and procedures as set out in \nparagraph 56 of the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring , institutions should \nensure that their credit sectoral policies, reflecting ESG risks, are cascaded down and trans-\nlated in to clear origination criteria available to business lines staff and credit decision -makers , \nand should ensure  that ESG risks are embedded into the credit risk monitoring framework . \n69. With regard to environmental risks, institutions should include in their policies and proce-\ndures a combination of qualitative and quantitative aspects. Based on their materiality as-\nsessment and their risk appetite, institutions should set quantitative cred it risk metrics cov-\nering the most significant client segments, type s of collateral and risk mitigation instruments.  \n \n5.6.2  Market risk  \n70. With respect to market risk, institutions should consider how ESG risks could affect the value \nof the financial instruments in their portfolio, evaluate the potential risk of losses on their \nportfolio and increased volatility in their portfolio’s value, and establish effective processes \nto control or mitigate the associated impacts as part of their market risk management frame-\nwork  including where needed reviewing  the trading book risk appetite and setting internal \nlimits for positions or client exposures .  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n33 \n \n5.6.3  Liquidity and funding risk  \n71. With respect to liquidity and funding risk, institutions should at least consider  how ESG risks \ncould affect net cash outflows (e.g. increased drawdowns of credit lines) or the value of assets \nthat constitute  their liquidity buffers and, where appropriate, incorporate these impacts into \nthe calibration of their liquidity buffers or their liquidity risk management framework.   \n72. In addition, with regard to environmental risks, institutions should  consider  how these  risks \ncould affect the availability and/or stability of their funding sources and take them into ac-\ncount in their management of funding risk . To this end, institutions should  consider different \ntime horizons and both normal and adverse conditions , which should reflect among others \nthe potential impacts of environmental risks on reputational risks , a situation of hampered or \nmore expensive access to market funding and/or accelerated deposit withdrawals . \n5.6.4  Operational and reputational risks \n73. With respect to operational risk, institutions should consider  how ESG risks could affect the \ndifferent regulatory operational risk event types  referred to in Article 324 of R egulation (EU) \nNo 575/2013 and their ability to continue providing critical operations and should incorporate \nmaterial ESG risks in their operational risk management framework.  \n74. With regard to environmental risks, institutions should : \na) identify and  label losses related to environmental risk s in their operational losses reg-\nisters , in line with the risk taxonomy and methodology to classify the loss events  set \nout by the regulatory technical standards adopted by the Commission pursuant to \nArticle 317(9) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 ; \nb) develop processes to assess and manage the likelihood and impact of environment -\nrelated litigation risks ; \nc) use scenario analysis  to determine how physical risk drivers can impact their business \ncontinuity ; and \nd) take material environmental risks into account when developing business continuity \nplans.  \n75. With respect to  reputational risks, institutions should consider and manage the impact of ESG \nrisks on their reputation, including by considering potential risks associated with lending to \nand investing in businesses which may be prone to ESG -related controversies , such a s viola-\ntions of social or human rights . Institutions should also consider, where applicable, the repu-\ntational risks associated with the failure to deliver on their sustainability commitments or \ntransition plans, or with the (perceived) lack  of credibility of such commitments and plans.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n34 \n \n76. As part of their management of conduct, litigation and reputational risks , institutions should \nhave in place sound processes to identify, prevent and manage risks resulting from green-\nwashing or perceived greenwashing practices taking into account the ESAs high -level princi-\nples set out in Section 2.1 of the EBA Final  Report on greenwashing monitoring and supervi-\nsion16. To this end, institutions should take all necessary steps to ensure that  sustainability -\nrelated  communication  is fair, clear, and not misleading , and that sustainability claims are \naccurate, substantiated, up to date, provide a fair representa tion of the institution’s overall \nprofile or the profile of the product, and are presented in an understandable manner. That \nshould be done at both the institution  level  (e.g. in relation to sustainability commitments \nincluding forward -looking targets ) and the product or activity level (e.g. in relation to products \nand activities marketed as sustainable) , includ ing by monitoring legal developments, market \npractices, and controversies around alleged greenwashing practices .  \n5.6.5  Concentration risk  \n77. With respect to concentration risk, institutions should consider  and manage the risks posed \nby concentrations of exposures or collateral in single counterparties , interdependent coun-\nterparties  or in certain  industries, economic sectors, or geographic regions which may present \na higher degree of vulnerability to ESG risks. To identify ESG -related concentration risks, insti-\ntutions should consider the size and/ or shares of their exposures that may be affected by ESG \nrisks relative to total exposure s and  as a proportion of  Tier 1 capital . Institutions should take \ninto account several ESG factors  amongst which GHG emissions, sectoral characteristics , vul-\nnerability of geographical areas to physical risks, and socia l or governance deficiencies or con-\ntroversies identified in jurisdictions where exposures or collateral are located , as well as the \navailability of risk mitigatin g factors . Institutions should assess if and how ESG-related con-\ncentration risk aggravate s the prior financial vulnerability of exposures.  \n5.7 Monitoring  \n78. Institutions should monitor ESG risks through effective internal reporting frameworks that \nconvey appropriate information and aggregated data to senior management and the man-\nagement body, such as by integrating ESG risks into regular risk reports or in the  form of dash-\nboards containing metrics that support  an effective oversight.  \n79. Institutions should monitor ESG risks on a continuous basis and ensure that they maintain an \ninstitution -wide view, adequately covering the nature, size  and complexity of their  activities , \nas well as, for the most significant portfolios  determined on the basis of the materiality as-\nsessment , a portfolio view of their vulnerability to ESG risks. Furthermore, i nstitutions should \nimplement granular and frequent monitoring of counterparties, exposures, and portfolios as-\nsessed as materially exposed to ESG risks, including through incorporating considerations o f \nESG risks into  the credit risk monitoring process of retail counterparties  and into regular credit \n \n16 EBA Final report on greenwashing monitoring and supervision (EBA/REP/202 4/09) \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n35 \n \nreviews for medium -sized and large counterparties and/or by increasing the frequency and \ngranularity of these reviews due to ESG risks.  \n80. Institutions should set early warning indicators and thresholds and should have in place pro-\ncedures to escalate alert s, deviations  and breaches  and to take  corrective and/or  mitigation \nactions in case limits  are exceeded, including through adaptations to business strategy and \nrisk management  tools . \n81. Institutions should monitor a range of backward - and forward -looking ESG risk metrics and \nindicators . Large institutions should monitor  at least the following indicators : \na) Amount and share of exposure s to, and income (interest, fee and commission) stem-\nming from , business relationships with counterparties operating in sectors that highly \ncontribute to climate change  in accordance with Recital 6 of Commission Delegated \nRegulation (EU) 2020/1818 , i.e. the sectors listed in Sections A to H and Section L of \nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 .  \nInstitutions should use a sectoral differentiation that is as granular as possible . In par-\nticular,  the degree of granularity should allow  institutions to monitor the amount and \nshare of exposures to, and income  stemming from , relationships with specific coun-\nterparties, such as  fossil fuel sector entities  and/or companies excluded from EU \nParis -aligned benchmarks17. \nb) Portfolio alignment metrics showing at a sectoral level  the extent to which exposures \nand production capacities operated by clients are, or are projected to be,  \n(mis -)aligned with a pathway consistent with the applicable climate legal and regula-\ntory objective, such as reaching net -zero GHG emissions by 2050, based on alignment \nmetrics relevant to the selected sectors and using methods described in Section 4.2 .3 \nb). \nInstitutions should complement th ese indicator s with information related to the as-\nsessment of potential financial risk impacts  resulting from misalignments . \nc) Financed GHG emissions  with a breakdown  by scope  1, 2 and  3 emissions  in absolute \nvalue and , where relevant , intensity  relative to units of production  or revenues , split \nby sectors , using a sectoral differentiation that is as granular as possible and  at least \nfor selected sectors determined on the basis of the materiality assessment.  \nInstitutions should complement these metric s with qualitative or quanti tative  infor-\nmation and criteria supporting the interpretation  of their  evolution  over time , includ-\ning e.g. a temporary increase  due to the provision of transition finance to GHG -in-\ntense counterparties,  and identifying the underlying drivers of the changes in emis-\nsions.  \n \n17 In accordance with Article 12 (1), points (d) to (g) , and Article 12 (2) of Climate Benchmark Standards Regulation . \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n36 \n \nExamples of methodologies or database s that may  support institutions  when  compu-\nting these metric s include the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the \nFinancial Industry, developed by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, \nand the Carbon Disclosure Project . \nd) The level of p rogress achieved in the implementation of key financing strategies de-\ntermined by the institution to ensure its resilience to ESG risks and preparedness for \nthe transition towards a more sustainable economy , e.g. by monitoring  financial flows \ntowards financial assets or counterparties that share a common set of characteristics  \nrelevant to the institution’s targets or risk appetite  in relation to ESG risks .  \ne) Client engagement metrics providing information about : \ni. the percentage of counterparties for which an assessment of  ESG risks has \nbeen performed , also as regards  their transition  strategies and , where avail-\nable , transition  plan s and their consistency with the institution’s objectives , \nspecifying the scope of selected sectors , products  and business lines covered \nby these assessment s; \nii. the results and outcomes of such engagement  such as  the positive (or any \nsub-classification within that category) or negative (or any sub-classification \nwithin that category) assessments of these counterparties’ adaptability and \nresilience to the transition to a sustainable economy , the alignment progress  \nagainst the institution’s targets and objectives,  and follow -up actions  taken \nby the institution . \nf) A breakdown of portfolios secured by real estate according to the level of energy ef-\nficiency of the collateral . \ng) The ratio of financing of low-carbon energy supply technologies in relation to the  fi-\nnancing of fossil -fuel energy supply technologies . \nh) The ratio  of environmentally sustainable exposures financing activities that contrib-\nute or enable the environmental objective of climate change mitigation  referred to in \nArticle 9 point (a) of Regulation (EU) 2020/85218 in relation to the  GHG -intense expo-\nsures .  \ni) Levels of physical risk the institution is exposed to , and their impact on financial risks , \nby considering  several scenarios and all hazards relevant to the institution’s activity , \nsupplemented with information on the  progress achieved in the  implementation of \nrisk mitigation measures . \n \n18 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a \nframework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088  (OJ L 198, 22/06/2020, p. 13) . \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n37 \n \nj) Measure s of concentration risk related to physical risk drivers (e.g. measurement of \nexposures and/or collateral in high flood risk , water -stressed or  wildfire risk areas)  \nand transition risk drivers (e.g. exposures to sectors with elevated transition risks),  by \nusing a sufficiently granular geographical split of exposures . \nk) Amount of h istorical losses related to ESG risks and, based on scenario -types meth-\nods, forward -looking estimate(s) of exposures -at-risk and potential  future  financial \nlosses related to ESG risks . \nl) A measure of ESG-related reputational risk  tracking  how regulation, communication , \ncommitments or public controversies regarding current and future business -related \nactivities impact directly or indirectly the institution , by considering interactions with \noperational risk and  strategic and business model risks , such as  loss of business \nopportunities or strategic partnerships . \nm) Any ESG -related litigation claims in which the institution has been, is or may become \ninvolved in, based on available information . \nn) The status of ESG risk -related capacity building , such as the percentage of staff who \nhave received specific training . \no) Metrics related to non -climate related factors such as portfolio -level dependencies \nand impacts on ecosystem services , or exposures to counterparties with material de-\npendencies or negative impacts on biodiversity , taking into account both sectoral and \ngeographical location information . \np) Progress against a ll of the institution’s targets set in relation to ESG risks and  ESG \nobjectives , including as part of the institution’s plan  as referred to in Section 6  or as \npart of other sustainability commitments  made by the institution . \n82. SNCI s and other non -large institutions should  monitor a range  of indic ators  included under \nparagraph 8 1, selected  on the basis  of the results of the ir materiality assessment , and s hould \ntake steps  to expand the list of monitored indicators over time .  \n83. Institutions should have c lear and  well-documented methodologies  pertaining to their moni-\ntoring metrics and indicators . When data needed to compute metrics is initially missing, insti-\ntutions should follow the steps  set out  in paragraph s 26, 27 and 29. \n \n  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n38 \n \n6. Plans in accordance with Article 76(2) \nof Directive 2013/ 36/EU \n6.1 Overarching  principle s \n84. Plans developed in accordance with Article 76(2) of Directive 2013/36 /EU are a product of the \ntransition planning process outlined in Section 6.3 and should be based on a forward -looking \nbusiness environment analysis  and a comprehensive strategic planning process within insti-\ntutions . They  should provide an overview of the strategic actions and risk management tools \ndeployed by institutions to demonstrate how they  ensure their  robustness towards ESG risks \nand preparedness for the transition towards a climate and  environmentally resilient and more \nsustainable economy . \n85. Institutions should ensure that their plans address forward -looking  ESG risk management \naspects  while being  consisten t with other applicable requirements  including those relating to  \ndue diligence, sustainability reporting , and strategic actions to ensure the compatibility of \nbusiness models with the transition to a sustainable economy . In particular, plans  should \ninclude objectives, actions and targets with regard to the business model and strategy of the \ninstitution that are consistent with the plans disclosed pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29a \nof the Directive 2013/34/EU, where applicable , and with ESG -related  objectives or \ncommitments that institutions are required to meet by law or regulation , as well as those they \nhave voluntarily set . Where institutions disclose plans in accordance with Article 19a \nparagraph 2 (a) (iii) or Article 29a paragraph 2 (a) (iii) of the Directive 2013/34/EU, they should \nconsider reusing the already available relevant information as a first step.  \n86. Institutions should ensure that their plans and targets are well integrated into their business \nstrategies and that they are aligned and consistent with their risk and funding strategies, risk \nappetite, ICAAP and risk management framework as set out in Section 5. The extensiveness  \nof the governance arrangements, transition planning process, and the degree of \nsophistication of objectives, targets and metrics of the plans should reflect  the nature,  size \nand complexity of institutions’ activity and  their mater iality assessment of ESG risks . \n87. In view of the institutions’ obligation to ensure that arrangements, processes and mecha-\nnisms related to their plans are consistent and well -integrated, including in their subsidiaries \nestablished outside of the U nion , and the obligation of those subsidiaries to be able to pro-\nduce data and information relevant to the purpose of supervising consolidated plans in ac-\ncordance with Article 109(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU, parent institutions should take into ac-\ncount ESG risks t o which  subsidiaries established outside of the U nion  are materially exposed \nwhen elaborating and implementing the consolidated plan, by having regard to applicable \nlocal legislation and ESG regulatory objectives, and should be able to demonstrate a wel l-\ninformed consolidated approach.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n39 \n \n \n6.2 Governance  \n6.2.1 Roles and responsibilities  \n88. Institutions should clearly identify and allocate responsibilities for the development, \nvalidation, implementation and monitoring of  the plans. When assigning roles and \nresponsibilities at the appropriate level of seniority, institutions should take into account the \ninterrelation and influence that the transition planning process should have on other \nprocesses such as the broader business strategy and risk appetite.  \n89. The management body should be responsible for the approval of the plans and should \noversee their implementation, including being regularly informed of relevant developments \nand progress achieved in relation to the institution’s targets  and taking decisions on remedial \nactions in case of significant deviations.  \n90. For the purposes of integrating ESG risks across the three lines of defen ce in line with Section \n5.4:  \na) the first line of defen ce should be responsible for establishing a dialogue with \ncounterparties about their own transition strategies and assess ing consistency with \nthe institution’s objectives and risk appetite , based on clear engagement policies  as \nset out in  paragraph  109 e(i). To this end, institutions should ensure that relevant staff \npossess sufficient expertise and capabilities to assess the extent to which the \ntransition strategies of  counterparties , including their transition plans where \navailable,  will enhance their resilience to ESG risks and align with the institution’s \ntargets ; \nb) the risk management function should ensure that the risk limits set in the risk appetite \nstatement as part of the risk management framework are consistent with all aspects \nof the institution’s plan, including sectoral policies ; \nc) the IAF should review the institution’s plan as part of the risk management framework \nand assess whether  it complies with legal and regulatory requirements and whether \nit is consistent with the risk strategy and risk appetite of the institution as regards  ESG \nrisks . To th is end, the IAF should consider whether  the plan allows the institution to \ndetect and address changes in its risk profile, how the institution addresses deviations \nfrom its targets, and whether the underlying assumptions, methodologies and criteria  \nhave been selected and used with integrity .  \n6.2.2 Internal processes and capacity  \n91. Institutions should ensure meaningful and regular interaction and exchanges at all levels of \nthe organi sation to ensure that insights and feedback from internal stakeholders can be taken \ninto account in the process of formulating, implementing and reviewing the plans. To this end, \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n40 \n \ninstitutions should at least involve units, departments and functions responsible for strategic \nplanning, risk management, sustainability disclosures, legal services and compliance in the \nelaboration of the plans, and should assess which additional units, departments and functions \nshould be involved.  \n92. In line with Section 5.4, i nstitutions should ensure they possess sufficient capacity, expertise \nand resources to develop  and implement their transition planning process as well as to \nregularly assess the robustness of their plans and monitor their implementation . Institutions \nshould map existing gaps in skills and expertise and take remedial actions where necessary . \n6.2.3 Data management  \n93. Institutions should have in place sound governance processes to collect, v alidate  and \naggregate the data that are needed to inform their transition planning effort s and monitor \ntheir implementation , including by using available public information  and counterparties’ \ntransition plan s as set out in Section  4.2.2.  \n6.3 Transition planning  \n6.3.1 Scenarios and pathways  \n94. Institutions should understand their sensitivity to ESG risks , in particular environmental \ntransition and physical risks , under different scenarios , including those implying higher levels \nof physical risk  or a disorderly transition . Institutions should understand how different \nscenarios may affect their transition planning efforts.  \n95. For the purposes of monitor ing and address ing the specific environmental risks that may stem \nfrom the process of adjustment towards the climate -related  and environmental regulatory \nobjectives of the jurisdictions in which  they operate , institutions should carefully select \nscenarios by taking all the following steps:  \na) assess the potential implications of EU, Member States and, where relevant, third \ncountries ’ objectives for  transition  pathways, at least for selected sectors determined \non the basis of the materiality assessment . In this process, institutions should take into \naccount  the likely pathways originated from the European Green Deal, the EU Climate \nLaw, and the latest reports and measures prescribed by the European Scientific \nAdvisory Board on Climate Change;  \nb) consider science -based and up -to-date scenarios  originating from national, EU or \ninternational organisations  as referred to in paragraph 38; \nc) take into account voluntary or regulatory -mandated objective s or commitment s of the \ninstitution with respect to climate change mitigation and adaptation.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n41 \n \n96. The geographical reference and granularity , such as in terms of  regional breakdowns , of the \nscenarios and pathways used by institutions should be relevant to their business model and \nexposures.  \n97. The range and complexity of the scenarios  used by institutions should be proportiona te to \ntheir size and complexity . SNCI s and other non -large institutions may rely on a simplified set \nof main parameters and assumptions , included risks, time  horizons considered, and regional \nbreakdown of impacts . Large institutions  should benchmark their plans (including final and \nintermediary targets) against a scenario compatible  with the limiting of global warming to \n1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement and with the objective of achiev ing climate neutrality \nby 2050  as established by the E U Climate Law . \n98. Institutions should ensure that scenarios and pathways used as part of their plans are \nconsistent across the organi sation and time horizons  considered , such as when building \nbusiness strategies and setting targets for the short, medium and long term . Institutions \nshould document the process for scenario selection , and the reasons for any change or \ndifferent usage.  Decisions to use different scenarios for different purposes as well as decisions \nto modify scenarios should be clearly justified.  \n6.3.2 Time horizons and milestones  \n99. Institutions should establish a set of different time horizons as part of their plans which should \ninclude the short term, medium term and a long -term planning horizon of at least 10 years. \nThe arrangements developed to monitor and address ESG risks across time horizons  should \ntake into account the principles outlined in paragraph 19. \n100. Institutions should set milestone s at regular time intervals  to monitor and address ESG risks \nthat stem from the short -, medium - and long -term regulatory objectives of the jurisdictions \nin which they operate. This includes the objectives of the EU to reduce GHG emissions by 55% \nby 2030 compared to 1990 level  and achieve net -zero emissions by 2050 , other intermediate \nclimate targets set by EU  or, where applicable , national  legislation , as well as  objectives \nrelated to other environmental factors such as nature rest oration19 or deforestation20.   \n101. Institutions should ensure that short -, medium - and long -term objectives and targets \ninteract and are well -articulated. This includes ensuring that long -term objectives, such as \ncommitments to achieve net -zero GHG emissions, translate into medium -term strategies (e.g. \nmedium -term sectoral policies or g rowth targets for business lines) and that short -term \nfinancial metrics or targets (e.g. profitability indicators, cost of risk, KPIs, KRIs, risk limits, \npricing frameworks) are coherent and consistent with th e medium -term and long -term \nobjectives.  \n \n19 Regulation (EU) 2024/1991 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 June 2024 on nature restoration and \namending Regulation (EU) 2022/869  (OJ L, 2024/1991, 29.7.2024).  \n20 Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 2023 on the making available on \nthe Union market and the export from the Union of certain commodities and products associated with deforestation and \nforest degradation and repealing Regulation (EU) No 995/2010  (OJ L 150, 09/06/2023, p. 20).  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n42 \n \n6.3.3 Materiality assessment basis  \n102. The transition planning process of institutions should aim at  manag ing material ESG risks , \nin particular environmental transition and physical risks  identified on the basis of  a robust , \nregularly updated  materiality assessment of ESG risks conducted in accordance with Section \n4.1. Institutions should  set out dedicated actions to monitor and address material ESG risks \nstemming from exposures , portfolios, and the economic activities and production capacities \nbeing financed, which may be particularly vulnerable to  the process of adjustment of the \neconomy towards the applicable legal and regulatory objectives related to ESG factors.   \n6.3.4 Metrics  \n103. Institutions  should use a range of metrics  including forward -looking metrics  to support \ntarget -setting  and drive  and monitor the implementation of their plans . \n104. For the purposes of setting targets, i nstitutions should use a set of metrics and  indicators  \nconsidering the ones included in paragraph 81. Institutions should determine , taking into \naccount their business strategies and risk appetite , which other  risk-based and forward -\nlooking metrics  and targets they will include in their plans with a view to monitoring and \naddressing ESG risks. This includes  assessing , com puting , and using  metrics to evaluate the  \nfinancial implications of transition planning for institutions’  business and risk profile over the \nshort, medium, and long term , including by measuring  the impact of transition planning on \nfinancial performance, revenue sources , profitability , and risk level of portfolios .  \n105. When data needed to compute metric s and support the setting of targets is missing, \ninstitutions should follow the steps outlined in paragraphs 26, 27 and 29. \n106.

Accompanying documents   \n7.1 Cost-benefit analysis / impact assessment  \n1. On 31 May 2024 , the European Commission published the directive  amending the Capital Re-\nquirements Directive (from now on CRD VI) . Article 87a of the CRD VI mandates the EBA to issue \nguidelines to specify minimum standards and reference methodologies for ESG risk manage-\nment practices.  These guidelines provide the EBA answer to such mandate.  \n2. As per Article 16(2) of the ESAs regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 \nand (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council), any guidelines devel-\noped by the ESAs shall be accompanied by an Impact Assessment (IA) annex which analyses ‘the \npotential related costs and benefits’ of the guidelines. Such annex shall provide the reader with \nan overview of the findings as regards the problem identification, the options identified to re-\nmove the problem and their potential impact s. \n3. The EBA prepared the  IA included in this section  analysing  the policy options considered when \ndeveloping the guidelines . Given the nature of the study, the IA is qualitative in nature.  \nA - Problem identification  \n4. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors  are causing and are expected to increasingly \nlead  to significant changes in the real economy that will in turn impact the financial sector \nthrough new risks and opportunities.   \n5. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the UN 2030 agenda for Sus-\ntainable Development in 2015, governments around the world are taking action to encourage \nthe transition to low -carbon and more sustainable economies. In Europe in pa rticular, the Euro-\npean Green Deal targets the ambitious objective of making Europe the first climate -neutral con-\ntinent by 2050 and it is expected that the financial sector will play a key role in this process.  \n6. In this regard, t he European Commission  has launched a set of initiatives to enhance the resili-\nence and contribution of the financial sector . As a result, several efforts have been initiated to \nincorporate ESG risks into prudential supervision . These guidelines target the inclusion of ESG \nrisks in institutions’ broader risk management frameworks.  \nB - Policy objectives  \n7. The main objective of the se guidelines is to answer the mandate set up in Article 87a of the CRD \nVI which requests the EBA to issue ESG risk management guidelines.  \n8. As a result, the general  objective is to provide guidance on how institutions will incorporate  ESG \nrisks in their risk management processes including defining how ESG risks should be considered \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n58 \n \nwhen defining business and risk strategies, risk appetite levels and internal controls, risk moni-\ntoring, etc.  \n9. The specific  objectives of the guidelines are defined in the CRD VI mandate which indicates that \nthe guidelines should specify:  \n- the minimum standards and reference methodologies for the identification, measurement, \nmanagement and monitoring of ESG risks;  \n- the content of plans  to be prepared in accordance with Article 76(2) of the CRD, which shall \ninclude specific timelines and intermediate quantifiable targets and milestones, in order to \nmonitor and address the financial risks stemming from ESG factors, including those arising  \nfrom the process of adjustment and transition trends towards the relevant Member States \nand Union regulatory objectives, in particular the objective to achieve climate neutrality by \n2050 as set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, as well  as, where relevant for internationally \nactive institutions, third country legal and regulatory objectives ; \n- the qualitative and quantitative criteria for the assessment of the impact of ESG risks on \nthe financial resilience and risk profile of institutions in the short, medium and long term.  \nC - Baseline scenario  \n10.  The current framework does not specify any guidelines about how institutions shall incorporate \nESG risks in their internal risk management nor it defines how institutions shall define their plans \nto monitor and address ESG risks . As a result, institutions may follow different criteria to con-\nsider ESG risks and incorporate them in their plans which would create divergencies in how \nbanks account for those risks and pose difficulty for the work of supervisors to monitor and \ncontrol that banks operate at adequ ate risks levels.  \nD - Options considered  \n11. When drafting the present guidelines, the EBA considered several policy options under nine \nmain areas:   \n1) Scope of the ESG risks covered by the  guidelines  \n \nArticle 87a of the CRD VI mandates the EBA to issue guidelines on ESG risk management \npractices. The definition of risk management practices for environmental but also for \ngovernance and social risks is a n ambitious target considering the less advanced data, \nmethodological and  regulatory developments in social and govern ance  aspects. Therefore, \nwhile developing the current guidelines, the EBA has analysed three possible options:  \n \nOption 1: To focus equally on the three aspects . \nOption 2: To focus on environmental aspects only . \nOption 3 : To mainly focus on environmental aspects but give some guidance on social and \ngovernment aspects.  \n \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n59 \n \n2) Frequency of the materiality assessment of ESG risks  \n \nInstitutions should regularly assess the potential effects of ESG risks on the ir business model s \nand risk  profile . Such assessment will provid e the institution with a view on the financial \nmateriality of ESG risks to which it is or may become exposed.  The adequacy of regularity in \nwhich such assessment sh ould  be carried out will ensure that the materiality of ESG risks \nremains adequately measured. Therefore, while developing the current guidelines, the EBA \nhas analysed three possible options:  \n \nOption 1: Every year for all institutions . \nOption 2: Every two years for all institutions . \nOption 3: Every year for non -SNCIs and at least every two years for SNCIs . \n \n \n \n3) Consideration of ESG risks in banks ’ business model s and strategies  \n \nThe needed transition towards a more sustainable economy will lead to  new business \nopportunities but will also expose financial institutions to risks stemming from the transition.  \nTherefore, while developing the current guidelines, the EBA has analysed if banks should \nconsider ESG risks when defining their business models and strategy. In particular, the EBA \nhas analysed two possible options:  \n \nOption 1: ESG risks should be considered in banks’ business models and strategies \nconsidering different time horizons.  \nOption 2: ESG risks may not be considered in banks’ business models and strategies.  \n \n4) Data processes  \n \nTo ensure an adequate identification and measurement of ESG risks, institutions sh ould  \nanalyse enough information and data . Therefore, while developing the current guidelines, \nthe EBA has analysed how banks ’ data processes sh ould  be defined to incorporate ESG risks. \nIn particular, the EBA has analysed three possible options:  \n \nOption 1: Institutions may  rely only  on publicly available ESG data, aggregate it and exploit \nit to manage ESG risks.  \nOption 2: Institutions sh ould  aggregate and exploit publicly  available data but also collect \nadditional ESG data when engaging with their clients and counterparties.  \nOption 3: Institutions should gather and use the information needed to assess current and \nforward -looking ESG risks , build ing on available ESG data but also considering where \nneeded collecting  data from  clients and counterparties or using  third -party data , and using \nwhere needed for certain counterparties proxies  or portfolio -level assessments . \n \n5) Features of reference methodologies for the identification and measurement of ESG \nrisks  \n \nWhen defining  their methodologies to identify and measure ESG risks, institutions sh ould  \nselect one or more features of reference. Therefore, while developing the current guidelines, \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n60 \n \nthe EBA has analysed two options regarding which are the most adequate features \ninstitutions sh ould  refer to:  \n \nOption 1: Institutions sh ould develop exposure -based, portfolio  and sector -based , and \nscenario -based methodologies.  \nOption 2: Institutions sh ould  develop methodologies based on at least one of the three \nelements included in option 1.  \n \n \n6) Materiality assessment  \n \nAppropriate risk managements frameworks as well as CRD -based  plans should be based on \na robust materiality assessment of the ESG risks faced by institutions . Therefore, while \ndeveloping the current guidelines, the EBA has analysed t hree  possible options:  \n \nOption 1: The materiality assessment  of ESG risks  should automatically define as material \ncertain exposures based on their sector .  \nOption 2: Institutions should have full flexibility when defining the materiality of ESG risks \nindependently from the sector of the exposure.  \nOption 3:  Institutions should consider certain criteria , exposures  and sectors  in their \nassessments while remaining responsible for determining their materiality , substantiat ing \nand document ing their assessments . \n \n7) Data and engagement with counterparties in relation to their transition plans  \n \nTo formulate and implement  an adequate plan  to monitor and address ESG risks , institutions \nneed to have information about the risks they face in the transition process  and engage \nclients . This includes using  information about their counterparties and their own risks during \nthe transition process. Therefore, while developing the current guidelines, the EBA has \nanalysed three  possible options regarding the engagement with counterparties:  \n \nOption 1: Institution s should engage and request all counterparties to submit a transition \nplan as part of the due diligence phase.  \nOption 2: Institution should engage and request large counterparties only to submit a \ntransition plan as part of the due diligence phase.  \nOption 3: Institution should consider collect ing forward -looking plans of at least  large \ncorporate counterparties, including transition plans disclosed under CSRD, and should \ndetermin e the scope of counterparties with whom to engage, taking into account \noutcomes of the materiality assessment and risk measurement methodologies .  \n \n8) Time horizons considered for banks’ plans  \n \nInstitutions need to consider several time horizons as part of their transition planning \nprocess . Therefore, while developing the current guidelines, the EBA has analysed four \npossible  options:   \nOption 1: To focus requirements on  short -term time horizons.  \nOption 2:  To focus requirements on  medium -term time horizons.  \nOption 3:  To focus requirements on  long -term time horizons.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n61 \n \nOption 4:  To consider several time horizons, including a long -term time horizon \narticulated with short - and medium -term  strategies . \n \n9) Plans’ targets  \n \nInstitutions should define targe ts as part of the ir plans. Therefore, while developing the \ncurrent guidelines, the EBA has analysed four  possible  options:  \nOption 1: To predefine the full list of metrics that institutions should target.  \nOption 2:  Not to predefine the list of metrics that institutions should target and allow \ninstitutions to define their own list of metrics.  \nOption 3: To include a minimum set of metrics that institutions should target while \nseeking to complement them . \nOption 4: To require institutions to consider using some metrics included in the guidelines \nwhile complementing them . \nE - Asse ssment of the options and preferred option  \n12.  In respect to the different options considered, the EBA has assessed their potential cost and \nbenefits, and has selected a preferred option in the nine main areas considered:  \n1) Scope of the ESG risks covered by the guidelines  \n \nESG risks include environmental, social and governance factors. Article 87a of the CRD VI  \nmandates the EBA to issue guidelines on management practices for the full scope of these risks. \nHowever, the EU and international regulatory developments for environmental risks are more \nadvanced than for social and governance risks. Although it is import ant to continue the \ndevelopment of management practices for the full set of ESG factors, it is also important to allow \nenough time for institutions to introduce the ne cessary changes. Therefore, in order to reduce \nthe burden for institutions and the time pressure to adapt to the new regulatory developments, \nit is considered that the guidelines should focus on environmental risk s mainly, although \nintroducing some high -level requirements  to define the management practices for social and \ngovernance  risks . This is indeed in line with the  sequenced approach adopted under other EBA \nregulatory products (e.g. Pillar 3 ITS ). Therefore, the preferred option is Option 3: To mainly \nfocus on environmental aspects but give some guidance on social and government aspects.   \n \n2) Frequency  of the materiality assessment of ESG risks  \n \nInstitutions sh ould  perform their  ESG risk materiality assessment with sufficient frequency  to \nensure that any development  in the external environment that could affect their exposure to \nESG factors are adequately capture d. Focusing on the E factor, environmental changes can \ndevelop in a fast manner , for example in terms of new policies or technologies or shifts in market \nand consumer preferences,  potentially affecting the level of banks’ exposures to environmental \nrisks . For these reasons, the EBA  consider s that banks’  materiality assessment should be carried \nout with a short -term periodicity to ensure that the relevant risk s are captured  sufficiently and \nin time . However, performing such assessment requires an intensive use of resources. It may be  \ndisproportionate to request all types of institutions to perform such assessment with a regularity \nof up to a year,  as small institutions have limited  resources available and such request could be \nburdensome for them . An adequate balanced approach would allow SNCI s to perform the \nmateriality assessment with lower regularity  although keeping an adequate periodicity to \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n62 \n \ncapture all potential risks. For these reasons, the preferred option is Option 3 : Every year for \nnon-SNCIs and at least every two years for SNCIs.  \n \n3) Consideration of ESG risks in banks ’ business models and strategies  \n \nThe following reasons justify the consideration of ESG risks in bank’s business models and \nstrategies:  \n- The time horizon of ESG risks: the full impact of ESG risks is likely to unfold in a long -\nterm period. Additionally, changes in business models may require some time to be \nimplemented. Therefore, it seems reasonable that institutions follow a forward -lookin g \napproach and consider ESG risks when defining their strategies and a business model \nthat will be viable and adequate when the ESG risks materialise.  \n- Potential negative financial impact : when defining their business model, institutions \nshould consider potential financial impacts that may be linked with their strategy. This \nincludes the consideration of ESG risks.  \n- Political actions in favour of  transforming the current global economy into a more sus-\ntainable one : there are several examples of political actions at international and EU \nlevel targeting a transition to a more sustainable economy. T hese initiatives could push \nfor significant changes in the business environment in the upcoming years . Banks \nshould anticipate the potential negative impact of such transformation and take ad-\nvantages of the arising new opportunities in the redefinition of their business model.  \n \nMoreover, i n recent years, some institutions have taken steps to account for ESG factors in their \nbusiness strategies.  However, as concluded in the EBA report on the m anagement and \nsupervision of ESG risks for credit institutions and investment firms34, more progress is still \nneeded to adequately incorporate ESG risks in banks ’ strategies and business models’ definition \nprocesses. Considering both the reasons that justify the integration of ESG risks in banks’ \nstrategies and business models and the current insufficient implementation in banks ’ processes, \nthe EBA considers that there is a need to incorporate such a requirement as part of the ESG risk \nmanagement guidelines and therefore the preferred option is Option 1 : ESG risks should be \nconsidered in banks’ business models and strategies considering different  time horizon s. \nAdditionally, given the distinctive impacts of ESG risks across different time horizons, banks \nshould consider different  (including a long -term ) time horizons when defining their business \nmodels.  \n \n4) Data processes  \n \nA robust risk management framework heavily relies on data to develop robust metrics and risk \nindicators. Well defined, strong data processes are key to adequately gather and exploit data to \nidentify and measure ESG risks . However, as explained in the EBA report on the m anagement \nand supervision of ESG risks for credit institutions and investment firms , the lack of data to \nidentify and measure ESG risks is one of the main challenges faced by institutions . The EBA has \nbalanced these two aspects when defining the way data processes sh ould  be integrated in \nbanks ’ ESG risk management guidelines. Given the importance of having accurate data to \nadequately measure ESG risks, it is considered that institutions sh ould  take action to better use \nand aggregate the data already available and that will be available as a result of EU and \ninternational developments on sustainability reporting on one hand  (e.g. CSRD/ESRS) , and on \n \n34 See report here . \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n63 \n \nthe other hand, improve the availability of ESG data via the collection of relevant ESG \ninformation from their clients and counterparties as part of their business relationship. There \nare other ESG regulatory developments such as the Pillar 3 disclosure requirements as per \nArticle 449(a) of Regulation (EU) 2019/876  that also push institutions to take action in a similar \ndirection. However, the collection of detailed ESG -related data for all counterparties may create \nan excessive burden for institutions. In order to reduce such a burden, the EBA considers that \ninstitutions should be able to use  external data in line with the outsourcing framework , as well \nas proxies , expert judgments and portfolio -level assessments  in those cases where data is not \navailable or its collection via engagement with clients and counterparties is considered \nexcessively difficult. Therefore, the preferred option is Option 3: Institutions should gather and \nuse the information needed to assess current and forward -looking ESG risks, bui lding on \navailable ESG data but  also considering where needed collecting data from clients and \ncounterparties or using third -party data, and using where needed for certain counterparties \nproxies or portfolio -level assessments.  \n \n5) Features of reference methodologies for the identification and measurement of ESG \nrisks  \n \nWhen drafting these guidelines, the EBA has analysed which feature s should be of reference for \ninstitutions when defining  their methodologies to identify and measure ESG risks. The possible \ntypes of methodologies that have been considered  include:  \na) exposure -based methodologies, which provide a granular assessment of the ESG factors at \ncounterparty level ;  \nb) portfolio  and sector -based methodologies  which allow institutions  to have a more compre-\nhensive risk assessment and to analyse the degree of alignment on a sectoral basis  of insti-\ntution’s portfolios with climate -related sustainability targets ; \nc) scenario -based analyses  to assess ESG risks allowing for a forward -looking perspective.  \nThe definition of methodologies to assess ESG risks at these different levels will answer to \ndifferent risk management needs. Therefore , the EBA considers that all aforementioned \nperspectives are needed to adequately measure ESG risks in a comprehensive manner and \ntaking into account the different time horizons in which ESG risks are expected to materialise. \nTherefore, the preferred optio n is Option 1: Institutions sh ould  develop exposure -based, \nportfolio  and sector -based , and scenario -based methodologies.  \n \n6) Materiality assessment  \n \nAppropriate risk management frameworks as well as CRD -based  plans should be based on a \nrobust materiality assessment of the ESG risks faced by institutions . To guarantee consistency \nacross all the processes in the institutions, the materiality assessment of ESG risks should be \nconsistent  with other materiality assessments carried out by the institution. To facilitate such \nstandardisation , institutions should refer to clear definitions of ESG risks  and th ere should be a \nminimum set of criteria, exposures and sectors to be considered as part of those assessments . \nGiven the limitations of broad, purely sector -based classification s, it is more appropriate to  not \nautomatically define certain sectors as materially exposed to ESG risks but to emphasise banks’ \nresponsibility to conduct robust assessments.  Therefore, the preferred option is  Option 3: \nInstitutions should consider certain criteria, exposures and sectors in their assessments while \nremaining responsible for determining their materiality, substantiating and documenting their \nassessments.  \n \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n64 \n \n7) Data and engagement with counterparties in relation to their transition plans  \n \nInstitutions need information about their counterparties’ risks during the transition process t o \nformulate and implement  an adequate CRD-based plan. However, institutions may encounter \nsome problems while collecting such information as first, not all counterparties may have \ndeveloped a clear and structured transition plan and , second, institutions will need resources to \ncollect transition plans from all counterparties, review and understand them and assess the \nrelevant risks. In other words, the collection of all necessary data and information from \ncounterparties is a complex and costly process for institutions. At the same time, a \ncomprehensive set of information is needed to adequately evaluate the risks. The direct \ninteraction between the institution and the counterparty to discuss the risks that the latter may \nface arising from the transition and possible options to mitigate them, is key to have a \ncomprehensive assessment and management of risk s. In order to strike the right balance , the \nEBA considers tha t such information should be obtained or collected at least for the large \ncorporate  counterparties as defined by the  CSRD . However, institutions should have all the \nrelevant data at their disposal to adequately assess the level of transition risk for all \ncounterparties. Therefore, the preferred option is Option 3:  Institution should consider \ncollect ing forward -looking plans of at least large corporate counterparties, including transition \nplans disclosed under CSRD, and should determine the scope of counterp arties with whom to \nengage, taking into account outcomes of the materiality assessment and risk measurement \nmethodologies.  \n \n8) Time horizons considered for banks’ plans  \n \nESG risks have distinctive impacts across time horizons. This is also the case when referring to \nESG risks arising from the transition process towards legal and regulatory objectives related to \nESG factors. Therefore, institutions sh ould  consider several time horizons when defining their \nplans. They should, however, include a horizon that is long enough to cover for those risks that \nmay fully materiali se in the long term. The preferred option is Option 4:  To consider several time \nhorizons, including a long -term time horiz on articulated with short - and medium -term  strategies  \n \n9) Plans’ targets  \n \nInstitutions should define targe ts as part of the ir plans. The EBA is aware that banks are already \nusing some metrics either voluntarily or based on current or (expected) future EU legislation  but \nthat developments are still ongoing to design most appropriate metrics  for target -setting . The \nEBA considers that  requiring institutions to both monitor several metrics and consider using \nsome of these metrics for target -setting purposes  will help achieving comparable plans and \nsupport  the work of supervisors in their reviews . At the same time, it is important to allow \ninstitutions flexibility in defining the  exact combination of metric s and setting the  level of targets \nthey deem appropriate  given their business strategies . It is also important to ensure that banks \nwill take steps to progressively include metrics related to non-climate -related  risks , in particular \nrisks stemming from the degradation of ecosystems and biodiversity loss , and compute and use \nmetrics relating to the financial implications of transition planning for their business and risk \nprofile . Therefore, the preferred option is Option 4:  To require institutions to consider using \nsome metrics included in the guidelines while complementing them   \n \n \n \n \n7.2 Feedback on the public consultation  \nSummary of responses to the consultation and the EBA’s analysis  \n \n \nComments  Summary of responses received  EBA analysis  Amendments to \nthe proposals  \n \nGeneral \ncomments  Overall, the Guidelines are broadly welcomed as stakeholders noted that \nefforts made by EU banks to assess and manage ESG risks have increased \nover recent years but still need to be amplified. A common European \nframework on the incorporation of ESG risks i n banks’ risk management and \ntransition planning will help in that regard and enhance the resilience of the \nbanking sector. E ffort s to give institutions clarity on the expectations \nsubstantiating the CRD requirements before setting out the implications in \nterms of  supervision  are appreciated. A wide range of views was nonetheless \nexpressed on several issues and whether the Guidelines strike the right \nbalance between ensuring a sufficiently robust and prudent management of \nESG risks and accounting for feasibility considering dat a and methodological \nchallenges.  The EBA has taken note of the comments \nreceived and thanks respondents for their \ncontributions. Answers to specific issues and \ncomments are included below.  \n \n \n Guidelines \namended as \ndescribed \nbelow.  \nRisk-based \napproach  The risk -based approach is supported but the Guidelines are not always \nconsistent with it, for instance when referring to the EU Climate Law , \nmeasures prescribed by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate \nChange  (ESABCC) , or the EU Taxonomy . \nThe blurring of the prudential boundary is evident through the references to \n‘objectives’ and ‘targets’ which appear to envisage the decarbonisation or \nreduction of institutions’ impact on ESG factors . The risk -based approach involves managing \nfinancial risks stemming from the transition \nprocess towards political objectives including \ncarbon neutrality. EU climate law, measures \nby ESAB CC and ‘targets’ are explicitly \nmentioned in CRD. See below for EU \nTaxonomy  and amendments to section 4.1.  Section 4.1 \namended.  \nAlignment with \nEU objectives  We wonder how the EBA conciliates its Guidelines that on the one hand \nexplain not requiring an objective of fully aligning with Member States or The Guidelines do not require to align \nportfolios  but to measure and monitor the Section  4.2 \nclarified.  \n \n \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n66 \n \nUnion sustainability objectives or one specific transition trajectory (i.e., a \n1.5°C or NZE objective), and on the other hand the requirements on portfolio \nalignment.  \nWhere the EBA does believe that it is relevant to cite external political \nobjectives and targets, it should clearly explain how institutions should \nconsider alignment/misalignment in relation to their own planning and the \nrisk implications.  degree of alignment as an input to strategy \nand risk management  decision -making in \nrelation to climate transition risks.  \n \n \nTransition \nfinance  The Guidelines should ensure that risk management strategies and plans \nhelp to support transition finance. Banks should be expected to develop a \nstrategic perspective on capturing and supporting opportunities that arise in \nthe transition, consistently with EU legal frameworks, but also to mitigate \nlong -term risks arising from lack of climate action.  The Guidelines require to consider ESG risks \nwhen formulating and implementing \nbusiness strategies. The section on plans \nrefers more explicitly to transition finance.  Section 6 \namended.  \nESG risks as risk \ndrivers  The EBA rightly considers ESG risks as risk drivers of traditional risk types and \nnot as a separate risk type.  \n \nThis approach is however not consistently applied in the Guidelines where \ncertain requirements suggest that ESG risks should be treated as a separate \nrisk category.  The definition of ESG risks provided in CRR \napplies throughout. To ensure that banks \nproperly assess impacts of ESG risks on \nfinancial risk types, additional processes or \nmodifications to existing processes are \nneeded and detailed in the Guidelines.  Sections 4.1, \n5.3, 5.5 clarified.  \nLevel of \nprescriptiveness  Not prescriptive enough. The G uidelines remain too principle based. The \nflexibility left and the lack of detailed requirements will undermine the \nquality of the exercise and could lead institutions to develop a purely \nadministrative exercise to justify not changing their approach to ma nage ESG \nrisks.  We recommend EBA to provide additional minimum safeguards and \nclarifications on the practical implementation . \n \nToo prescriptive.  The Guidelines should adopt a principles -based approach . \nThe consultation paper sometimes takes an  overly  prescriptive  approach  \nthat does not account for challenges  faced by banks  and would  \nconstrain  the institutions’ learning  curve  on ESG risks.  \nSufficient flexibility should be left - and maintained over time  – with regard \nto: methodologies and use of proxies; risk mitigation tools; engagement with \ncounterparties; data sourcing and gathering; indicators, metrics and targets  The EBA has considered the range of views \nreceived on the level of prescriptiveness of \nthe draft Guidelines. The EBA recalls that its \nmandate is to specify minimum standards, \ncriteria and methodologies for the \nidentification, measurement, management \nand mo nitoring of ESG risks. Delivering on \nthis mandate entails providing harmonised \nand generally applicable requirements with a \ndegree of granularity. Given the fact that \nmanagement of ESG risks is evolving, the \nGuidelines have nonetheless maintained a \ndegree of flexibility for institutions to \ndevelop their methodologies. Institutions No fundamental \nchanges.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n67 \n \nas b anks should set their own metrics and targets based on their own \nstrategies.   \nThe Guidelines should f ocus on institutions’ achievement of appropriate \nprudential risk outcomes rather than over -specifying the means and/or \nmethod by which institutions should identify, measure, monitor and manage \nESG risks.  A \"demand -based approach\"  may be considered  in which the \nobjectives are explained to the institutions but the path to their \nimplementation must be taken largely independently. As another possible \nmodel, we would like to recommend a \"solution -based approach\". Here, the \ntools for assess ment and for the management of ESG risks are developed and \nexplained, even trained and then published by the supervisory authority.  \nThe Guidelines could b etter distinguish between mandatory requirements \nand recommendations for good practices.  remain responsible for developing business \nstrategies and for determining the best \ncombination of risk mitigation tools they will \nimplement.  \nThe EBA also recalls that Guidelines set \nrequirements institutions should comply \nwith, and not good practices.  \n \nTime horizons  The guidelines should reflect on what long term entails for prudential \npurposes. It coul d be clarified that long -term horizon is not expected for \nevery risk management tool  as this would be too excessive and demanding . \nThe definition of long -term  as at least 10 years should be  specific to the \nclimate and environmental elements and for the purposes of prudential \ntransition plans.  Medium and long -term assessments are expected to be \nmainly qualitative/ subjective/ expert based so supervisory expectations \nshould be high level.  \nLong -term horizon is not consistently applicable across E, S, G risks. More \nspecifically, given the uncertainty around social and governance factors, \nalong with the lack of clear long -term goals , long -term time horizons may not \nbe relevant for S and G risk drivers.  A sound management of ESG risks should \nconsider the short, medium and long term as \nrequired under CRD. However, the \nGuidelines clarify that t he level of granularity \nand quantification of tools and indicators \nused by institutions should be higher for the \nshort and medium term. Long -term time \nhorizons should at least be considered from a \nqualitative perspective and support strategic \nconsideration s.  \n Sections 4.1, \n5.5. and 6 \namended.  \nScope – scenario \nanalysis, \ndisclosures, \ncapital \nrequirements  More guidance is needed on how to perform ESG scenario analysis, foster \ntransparency of institutions’ practices, and ensure that supervision and \nenforcement of the Guidelines will be effective.  \nMore support to green investments and/or h igher capital requirements for \nfossil fuel -related assets held by banks need to be considered in the \nprudential framework.  These comments deal with aspects that are \naddressed by separate mandates on \nincorporation of ESG risks in scenario \nanalysis, supervision, disclosures (revision of \nthe Pillar 3 standards) and the prudential \ntreatment of exposures.  No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n68 \n \nScope – banking \nbook and credit \nrisk The Guidelines should be limited to the banking book and focused on credit \nrisk, while foreseeing a gradual approach for enlarging the scope to trading \nbook and other risk types when they become more mature and/or material.  \nLimited  progress has been made on assessing climate -related financial risk \ntransmission mechanisms for exposures held for trading. Positions held in \nthe trading book are actively risk managed , held for very short time horizons \nand, as such, may not present a very meaningful reflection of how the bank \nis exposed to climate -related risk factors. If the trading book was to be in \nscope of the final Guidelines, it would be necessary to phase in the \nrequirements to allow time for solving data and methodological i ssues.    ESG risks can affect various financial risk \ntypes and banks should ensure a \ncomprehensive assessment of ESG risks \nbased on their business model and scope of \nactivities. Given more advanced \nunderstanding on transmission channels to \ncredit risk, more extensi ve requirements are \nincluded on the latter.  \n No change  \nArticulation with \nECB Banks under direct SSM supervision are already under significant pressure by \nthe ECB on environmental risks management.  The Guidelines should be \narticulated with CRD  on one hand and the supervisory practice on the other \nhand. It is desirable to have a common regulatory and supervisory attitude \ntowards ESG . EBA and ECB should  ensure alignment and clarity of application \nof the respective Guidelines.   The Guidelines have been prepared with all \ncompetent supervisory authorities in the EU, \nincluding the SSM. They take into account \nsupervisory experience on both \nshortcomings and progress of banks. The \nGuidelines apply to all EU banks and \nsupervisors.  No change  \nInternational \ndevelopments / \nLevel playing \nfield  The framework for ESG risks is still evolving at the international level. \nConvergence of EU regulations with international standards is important to \nensure the level playing field and  avoid complexity having to comply with \ndifferent requirements within the same group  for international banks . \nCertain stringent requirements may generate unlevel playing field, with a risk \nthat clients divert from EU institutions to the benefit of non -EU institutions \nthat are not subject to such requirements.  \nThe treatment and relevance of financial institution transition planning is \ncurrently an area of active discussion and analysis at the international level. \nGiven that the EBA’s mandate does not require the publication of these \nspecific guidelines until 18 months following the entry into force of the CRD, \nthe EBA could use the allowed time to engage with other authorities globally \nand work towards a more aligned approach. The EBA could conduct further \nconsultation on the transition planning element in its dr aft Guidelines later \nto reflect international developments . The Guidelines take into account BCBS \nprinciples on climate -related risks and \ninternational developments (e.g. NGFS, \nBCBS) on transition planning, to which the \nEBA and its members contribute. They \nhowever provide further details as they are \nbased on the EU  legal framework. The EBA \nsupports international convergence on ESG \nrisks management and considers that sound \nrisk management and transition planning \nstrengthen banks’ business model. Future \nupdates to the Guidelines may reflect \ninternational developments if needed.  \n No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n69 \n \nEU requirements should be interoperable with future international \nstandards, which may require future revisions to the EU approach.  \nDate of \npublication and \ndate of \napplication  The EBA state s that their intention is to publish the Guidelines towards end \nof 2024 and for the application date to be aligned with the application date \nof the amended Directive 2013/36/EU. However, the proposed amendments \nto CRD only require that the EBA publish these Guidelines within 18 months \nfrom date of entry into force of this amending  Directive and do not set \nspecific timelines for the application date of the Guidelines. We would \nquestion why the EBA is seeking to publish significantly in advance of this \ndate . Clarification on the application date  of the Guidelines would be \nappreciated.  \n \nConsidering the current state of methodological developments and the \nnumerous regulatory requirements banks will have to comply with the next \nfew years (notably CSRD), banks will need sufficient time for the application \nof the Guidelines. Implementation pe riod of at least two years is crucial, \ngiven the complexity of the topic and its interdisciplinary nature (data, IT, \nstrategy, risk processes).  \nLarge institutions within the meaning of the CSRD that qualify as SNCIs and \nare treated as listed SMEs in the CSRD are only subject to the corresponding \nreporting obligations for the 2028 reporting year. This should be taken into \nconsideration when finalizi ng the Guidelines.  The EBA has published the Guidelines in \nadvance of the deadline provided by the CRD \nand decided to align the date of application \nwith the date of application of CRD6 i.e. \nJanuary 2026, for most banks. This early \npublication ensures clarity over upcoming \nrequirements and gives time to institutions \nto prepare for both the implementation of \nnew obligations under CRD6 and compliance \nwith the Guidelines. To ensure \nproportionality and considering other \nregulatory developments e.g. CSRD, a one -\nyear phase -in is pro vided for the date of \napplication of the Guidelines to SNCIs (i.e. \napplication at the latest from January 2027).  \n \n Date of \napplication \ndelayed by 1 \nyear maximum \nfor SNCIs.  \n \nQuestion 1: EBA’s understanding of the plans required by Article 76(2) of the CRD, and articulation with other EU requirement s \n \nDefinition of \nPlan(s)  When respondents expressed their direct view on EBA’s understanding, they \nnearly all agreed it was an appreciated effort and solid tentative to provide \ndirections and definition based on CRDVI mandate. Yet albeit appreciated, \nmany had comments, questions, and suggestions about the definition of \n(transition) plan(s) and how many plans should exist and flexibility around it. \nSome respondents express their clear preference for focused, risk -based or The EBA Guidelines use the same language as \nper CRD where its mandate originates. To \nreflect the different but closely related \nstrategic efforts spanning various EU \nrequirements, the background now further \nclarifies that plans are output of a single \ntransi tion planning process which includes all Background and \nsection 6.1 \nupdated.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n70 \n \nsingle plans only, while others either appreciate the flexibility of the GLs or \nexpress strong single transition plan views.  relevant strategic and implementation \naspects.  \nArticulation with \nEU and other \npractices  Regarding the articulation with CSRD/CSDDD/ISSB/BCBS, answers revolve \naround three clear and complementing points on that matter:  \n- (further) Clarification needed overall  \n- The absolute necessity of (more) alignment and consistency with \nCSRD (and CSDDD and ISSB to a lesser extent) with another clarifica-\ntion sought on articulation and feeding directions between plans.  \n- Avoiding overlaps between requirements and create complementing \nframeworks.  Linkage with EU disclosure and due diligence \nframeworks is further recalled in the \nGuidelines background where the \ncomplementary purposes of the different EU \nrequirements are stressed.  \nSee also below on section 6 and annex.  \n Background \nupdated  \nPlans validation  A few respondents asked for supervisors’ validation of plans, mostly through \nSREP while one respondent would prefer less formality.  Supervision of CRD -based plans is out of \nscope of these Guidelines. The background \nhowever recalls that banking supervisors will \nassess their robustness as part of SREP, as per \nCRD6.  Background \nupdated  \nReference and \npathways \ntowards EU 2050 \nobjective  Respondents raised a ntagonistic views spanning ‘no pathway – no alignment \n– no need to align as it is risk choice ’ to improved and inclusive definition to \nexplicitly mention EU 2050 objective in definition and/or scenarios or (more) \npathways.  \nRespondents also raised questions such as:  \n- Does referring to CSRD suffice to imply that EU 2050 is a target – \nsome would like it to be more explicit.  \n- Some see no need to indicate or refer to pathways as this is a risk \ndocument.  \nWhich feeds which: CSRD is expected to feed CRD but CSRD is still evolving.  The Guidelines stress that they are not \nprescribing a specific climate or ESG objective \nbut require transition planning efforts to take \ninto account the likely pathways implied by \nEU legislation and targets.  \nSee also above on alignment with EU \nobjectives.  \n Section 6 \namended  \nGroup / SNCIs \nscope / \nProportionality  Some respondents preferred a scope of application at Group level only for a \nplan, while others preferred EU entity level and not at Group level or asked \nfor more clarity overall.  \nWhile proportionality is a recurring theme on various subtopics, there are \nexplicit requests to remove demands for SNCIs or take into account the CRD6 \nwaiver option, and not having to create a plan solely because CSRD \ndisclosures are needed.  The level of application of the Guidelines is \naligned with the level of application specified \nin CRD article 109.  \nWith regard to SNCIs , CRD requires them to \nhave a plan. It is clarified that in case Member \nStates decide to use the CRD ‘waiver ’ Background \nupdated  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n71 \n \nprovision, the GLs will apply dependent on \nthe transposition into national law.  \nSectors / \nDivesting  Some respondents suggest explicit sectors divesting should be present in the \nrequirements related to CRD -based plans (mostly fossil fuels).  \n \nOverall divesting is seeing more cautiously from other respondents given it \ncould have some unintended effects.  The goal of CRD -based plans is not to force \ninstitutions to exit or divest from greenhouse \ngas-intensive sectors but to thoroughly \nassess risks and to prepare accordingly \nthrough structured transition planning, \nincluding by engaging clients and supporting \nthem where appropriate, notwithstanding \nother mitigation actions consistent with \nsound risk management.   No change  \n \nQuestion 2: Proportionality approach  \n \nSize versus \nbusiness model \nand risk profile  \n Proportionality seems to be mostly based on institution’ size as illustrated by \nthe Guidelines’ references to SNCIs.  \n \nProportionality is a crucial principle for Pillar II and should be considered \nmore holistically and not only with regard to the size of the institution. \nProportionality should be better linked to the business model , risk profile of \na bank  and to the level and materiality of the financial risk . \n \nSmaller institutions may have even higher  ESG risks due to less diversified \nportfolios and higher sectoral (e.g. agriculture) and/or geographical \nconcentrations. Hence it would not be sound to reduc e or suspend \nrequirements  for them.  \n \nDifferent institutions have varying capacities and resources. The process of \nadaptation to robust ESG risk management could be a significant challenge \nfor many small institutions.   Size is not the decisive factor in the \nGuidelines, rather the risk materiality \nassociated with institutions’ activities and \nbusiness model, in line with CRD art 87(a)(2 ) \nand recognising  that smaller institutions are \nnot necessarily  less exposed to ESG risks . \nNonetheless , smaller and less complex \ninstitutions can  implement less sophisticated  \nprocesses given their limited resources.  \nSome simplifications are thus provided for \nSNCIs and in certain cases also for all non -\nlarge institutions.  \n Background \nclarified  \nCost/benefit  Proportionality should be ensured regarding the cost/benefit analysis of the \nmeasures proposed. The incorporation of ESG -related risks in the prudential A cost -benefit analysis is included in section  \n7.1. The benefits of the requirements of the Section 7.1 \nupdated  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n72 \n \nframework will imply a significant workload for institutions – it is therefore \nimportant that the proposed requirements provide actual value -added both \nfrom an ESG risk management and supervisory perspective.  Guidelines are considered to outweigh costs \ngiven the importance of a sound \nmanagement of ESG risks .  \nProportionality \nthroughout the \nGuidelines  Proportionality should be applied throughout the Guidelines. A paragraph on \nthe application of the proportionality principle may be added in Chapter 2 \n'Subject matter, scope and definitions' rather than only mentioned in the \nbackground.  \n \nProportionality should apply to all the Guidelines’ requirements, allowing \ninstitutions to focus on the most material risks. The Guidelines should clarify \nthat all requirements are subject to the materiality principle.  If materiality \nassessments of ESG risks do not identify material ESG risks transmission \nchannels from counterparties, requirements such as identification data, \nengagement with counterparties, and internal reporting metrics should be \nconsidered in a propor tionate manner, regardless of the size  of the \ninstitution. Based on this principle, only relevant risk category(ies) i.e. E, S or \nG factors should follow the processes indicated in the Guidelines . \nExcessively harsh  or detailed  requirements  could entail the risk of  ineffective  \nmechanisms , a resource allocation inconsistent  with the effective level of \nfinancial risk , creating a tick box list and/or banks withdrawing from some \nsectors  hence jeopardizing the supply of credit required for the trans ition . The clarifications regarding the \nproportionality approach are reflected both \nin the background and in the main body of \nthe Guidelines, such as sections 4.1 and 6.1.  \n \nProportionality cannot lead to a \nconsideration of whether to implement the \nGuidelines or not. However, the \nextensiveness of the various risk \nmanagement processes and procedures \nshould be proportionate to the outcomes of \nthe institution’s materiality assessment.  \n Sections 4.1  and \n6.1 clarified  \nSME clients  The principle of proportionality  must extend beyond financial institutions to \nencompass their business partners in particular  SMEs . SMEs should receive \nthe necessary support to address ESG challenges without facing financial \npenalties or too demanding data collection efforts. Banks’ management of \nESG risks for SMEs  should be based only on data to be reported based on  \nEFRAG ’s proportional and voluntary sustainability reporting standards . The Guidelines  do not penalise SME financing \nand data collection efforts are targeted \ntowards large corporates.  \nA reference to voluntary  reporting  standard \nfor SMEs has been included.  Section 4.2.2  \namended  \nScope of \naddressees  A consistency with CSRD and CSDDD would mean that the addresses of the \nGuidelines are consistent with those of CSRD, CSDDD. Therefore, the \nGuidelines should not address SNCIs in general, but only bigger SNCIs, similar \nto CSRD.  The Guidelines are based on CRD which \nappl ies to all institutions , but they  embed  \nproportionality , see above .  No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n73 \n \nSpecific business \nmodels  The proportionality approach can be further promoted for some types of \ninstitutions with specific business models such as national promotional banks \nor institutions that focus on positive ESG -related activities and have lower \nexposure to regulatory, transi tional and reputational risks. A business model \nguided by the principles of the social economy cannot reasonably be \ninterpreted as \"more\" prone to risk. It is of utmost importance that such \nbanks be recognized as such, and that their business model be \nackn owledged.  It is not appropriate for the Guidelines to \nrecognise or distinguish between specific \nbusiness models, but proportionality should \napply  based on the ESG risk materiality \nassociated with institutions’ activities.   No change  \nSupport for small \ninstitutions  To further support smaller institutions, the EBA should consider providing \nmore tailored guidance or examples on understanding, defining, and \nimplementing proportionate ESG risk management practices. Additionally, \nfacilitating access to ESG data and risk a ssessment tools could help smaller \ninstitutions meet the Guidelines without disproportionate effort.  The simplifications provided for SNCIs aim at \nfacilitating their implementation of the \nGuidelines.  \nSee also below regarding access to ESG data.  Background and \nsection 4.2 \namended  \nUpdate \nfrequency  The option for small, non -complex institutions to carry out the review of risk \nstrategies/policies only every two years, as set out in Art. 76 (1) CRD, should \nbe used . Proportionality is provided regarding the \nfrequency of updates of materiality \nassessments and plans, for the latter in line \nwith Art 76(1) CRD.   Section 6 \nclarified  \nIdentifying \nsimplifications  An annex to guidelines or a synoptic table outlining the facilitations or \nsimplifications granted to SNCIs would be helpful in providing an overall view \nof the simplifications applied in line with the proportionality principle.  Simplifications provided for SNCIs are \noutlined  in the background .  \n Background \namended  \n \nQuestion 3: Consideration of climate, environmental, and social and governance risks  \n \nGeneral \ncomments  Stakeholders broadly supported the Guidelines’ approach i.e. the emphasis \nput on E while including some general requirements on S and G risks. There \nis wide recognition that most progress has been achieved on climate -related \nrisks in the financial sector and this should be reflected in the requirements.  \n \nTwo conflicting views have however been expressed:  \n- A first category of respondents considers that a more comprehensive \napproach is needed and further guidance would be justified on non -\nclimate aspects. S and G are also sources of financial risk and affect Overall the Guidelines maintain the emphasis \nput on environmental risks, while still \ncontaining minimum requirements for social \nand governance risks.  \n \nA restricted scope on E would not be in line \nwith the CRD provisions. However, the \nGuidelines recognise that approaches for \nsocial and governance risks are expected to Section 4.2 \namended.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n74 \n \nbanks’ counterparties. The full spectrum of ESG factors is captured \nby frameworks such as CSRD, SFDR, SASB materiality mapping or the \nUN SDGs. More guidance is needed on how to approach social risks \nfor specific customer segments or industries.  \n- A second category of respondents on the other hand called for an \neven more gradual and phased approach, starting with environmen-\ntal considerations and in particular climate aspects. This would re-\nflect the maturity level reached on various dimensions (e.g. data, \nmethodologies) and their specificities (e.g. differences in transmis-\nsion channels, time horizons, systemic nature of E versus idiosyn-\ncratic nature of S and G). The Guidelines should focus on climate and \nprovide flexibility regarding management of S a nd G risks, with no \nmandatory KRIs and only qualitative requirements. They could fur-\nther capture non -climate aspects at a later stage e.g. in future up-\ndates when analytical and operational challenges are addressed.  be gradually enhanced in line with regulatory \nand methodological progress.  \n \n \n \nCSRD and CSDDD  The Guidelines could further build on CSRD. CSRD will result in more data \navailable on all ESG aspects and also addresses risk management processes \nand strategies. The data that will be reported by counterparties should be \nthe foundation of banks’ approach  to social risks. CSRD also defines ESG \nfactors as opposed to CRD. CSDDD refers to violations of rights and \nprohibitions included in international human rights agreements, with a long \nlist of human rights and fundamental freedom conventions. The Guidelines  \ncould add that banks should pay attention to any risk deriving from the \nviolation of legal duties established to pursue social goals in force at national \nlevel, in the jurisdiction of the client.  Further alignment with CSRD has been \nensured for instance in terms of data items \ninstitutions should collect.  \nThe Guidelines require banks to take into \naccount adherence of counterparties to \napplicable social standards, in line with those \nmentioned in CSRD.  Section 4.2. \namended  \nMore support \nneeded  It would be useful to shape an internationally agreed roadmap for the \ngradual integration  of social and governance factors towards quantitative \nmeasures.  \n \nThe EBA could consider developing a common risk taxonomy across ESG risk \nareas , including a taxonomy of nature related risk drivers.  Such initiative would be welcomed by the \nEBA.  \nThe EBA is not necessarily best placed to do \nthat, however developments on supervisory \nreporting are ongoing and the final \nGuidelines further refer to nature -related \nrisks (see below).  No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n75 \n \nNature related \nrisks – caution \nneeded  Greater distinction should be made between climate and non -climate \naspects such as biodiversity, given the different maturity levels in the \nunderstanding, measurement and management of associated financial risks.  The Guidelines require quantification of \nclimate -related risks and proper \nunderstanding of nature -related risks.  Background and \nsection 4.2.1 \namended  \nNature related \nrisks – need for \nmore \nrequirements  Assessment of nature -related financial risks can already be done. The \nfinancial sector is vulnerable to destabilising impacts of environmental \nchanges, scientific evidence is available (IPBES assessments), half of world’s \nGDP is highly dependent on nature,  and key sectors and companies have \nbeen identified as high -risk e.g. for deforestation. There are gaps in \nmanagement and disclosure of nature -related risks and opportunities by \nfinancial institutions, and a need to integrate further forest and water relat ed \nrisks in strategies. More recommendations on nature related risk \nmanagement should be included in the Guidelines, starting with \ndeforestation and/or building on first publications available (NGFS, TNFD, \nSBTN). An integrated approach is needed given the climate -nature nexus.  The Guidelines have been amended to \nfurther explain the relevance of nature -\nrelated risks - covered by the definition of \nenvironmental risks in CRR - in the \nbackground as well as to clarify requirements \nin terms of materiality assessment and risk \nmeasureme nt methodologies.  \n Section 4 \namended  \nScope of E risks  We understand that ecosystems degradation and biodiversity loss may be \nonly examples of a broader range of elements, which leaves a certain degree \nof uncertainty. For example, would institutions be expected to include water \nand pollution matters in heat maps?  Environmental risks are defined in CRR. \nInstitutions should take into account a broad \nrange of E factors.  No change  \nInteractions \nbetween E, S, G \n– conceptual \ncomments  ESG issues are interconnected and should be considered holistically, by \nconsidering macro trends and the entire production chain of economic \nactivities e.g. for electric vehicles.  \nThe green transition can have both positive and adverse effects on social \nissues.  See below regarding clarifications provided \non interactions.  No change  \nInteractions \nbetween E, S, G - \nsuggestions  No guidance.  It is difficult to provide generally applicable guidance on how \nto deal with interactions. Interdependencies between E, S, G risks would be \nbest considered by institutions in individual risk assessments rather than \nthrough  general  requirements in the Guidelines . \nMore guidance . The EBA could provide further guidance on how to handle \ninteractions and/or illustrations on how to do it.  \nLimited guidance.  The Guidelines could specify that banks should understand \ninterconnections between various dimensions and consider them in risk \nmanagement practices.  The Guidelines include a new paragraph \nwhich states that w ith regard to the \ninteractions between the different categories \nof, respectively, environmental, social and \ngovernance risks, institutions should apply an \napproach that firstly assesses each category \nof risk taking into account its specific \ncharacteristics , before considering potential \ninterconnections.  This should prevent the Section 4.2.1 \namended  \n \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n76 \n \n \nBanks should avoid using aggregated scores for ESG and focus separately on \neach dimension to avoid black boxes or mixing risks of various nature and \nmagnitude.

In particular, one single plan for both climate and nature \nwould be justified.  Requirements on plans are focused on \nclimate risks but other E and S&G risks cannot \nbe ignored, in line with CRD.  No fundamental \nchange but \nsection 6 \nclarified  \nPara 26 - Double \nmateriality  Not for the Guidelines.  Double materiality is relevant for sustainability \nreporting but not for micro -prudential risk management. We recommend \nthat the Guidelines refer to financial materiality only since they are focused \non risk management . The last sentence of para 26 – i.e. conditionality on \nfinancial risks – should be mentioned in the core text of the Guidelines, not \nonly in the background.  \nNeed for more recognition . Double materiality should be recognised more \nclearly and integrated throughout the Guidelines, in line with CSRD \napproach.  \nTargeted clarification.  The Guidelines strike a good balance but could further \nclarify how (adverse) impact that a counterparty may have can entail \nfinancial risks for institutions, for instance through a range of risk categories \nincluding  strategic , litigation and reputation risks .  The Guidelines are focused on financial \nmateriality in line with CRD but clarify that \nadverse impacts should be taken into \naccount to the extent that they can drive \nfinancial risks and/or reputation, litigation \nand business model risks.  Background \nclarified  \n \nQuestion 4: Materiality assessment  \n \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n77 \n \nGeneral \ncomment  The materiality assessment is a key exercise as an inadequate assessment \nwould undermine the adequacy of the risk management approach as a \nwhole . The conclusions of the EBA monitoring exercise on the IFRS9 \nimplementation serve as evidence for the need of such guidance, as the EBA \nhas identified largely divergent practices of banks when handling forward -\nlooking information for risk assessments . Robust materiality assessments are key and \npositioned as starting points for sound ESG \nrisk management approaches.  Section 4.1 \namended as \nexplained below  \nFlexibility  Not enough.  Guidance should not be too prescriptive (one size fits all) and \nshould enable some flexibility on how to approach materiality assessment as \nbanks may have developed other internal indicators to identify \nhomogeneous exposures in terms of ESG (e.g. as an al ternative to proposed \nactivities, services, products segmentation). Individual institutions should \nhave greater flexibility to assess the materiality of ESG risks in their specific \nportfolios and across their sectoral exposures.  \nToo much.  The expectations for the execution of the materiality assessment \nshould be better specified completed with minimum safeguards to improve \nthe reliability of the exercise. The introduction of qualitative/quantitative \nthresholds would be useful . The Guidelines strike a balance between \nproviding minimum standards and criteria \nand maintaining the responsibility of banks to \nconduct materiality assessments that \ncorrespond to their business model and risk \nprofile. The Guidelines do not specify \nthreshol ds but require banks to document \ntheir methodologies including any threshold \nused. See also below on question 5.  No change  \nSignificance of \nactivities, \nservices and \nproducts  There should be further clarification on how materiality and how the \nsignificance of activities, services, products should be measured . The \nsignificance of activities, services and products could be determined through \nmeasurable indicators.  \n§14b should clarify that the activities can be considered as most significant \nnot only from the perspective of their relative size in the portfolio but most \nimportantly from the perspective of the potential of these activities to \ngenerate substantial impac ts for instance in terms of reputation.  It has been clarified that institutions should \nensure that the scope of their materiality \nassessment sufficiently reflects the nature, \nsize and complexity of their activities, \nportfolios, services and products . Institutions \nshould document their methodologies \nincluding indicators.  Section 4.1 \nclarified  \nQuantification  It should be clarified, when referring to the quantitative view to capture \npotential impacts of ESG risks, that it should not necessarily be a capital or \nP/L impact. Rather, the quantitative view may be supported by the \ndetermination of the amounts of exposures and revenues that are \nsignificantly exposed to the said risks.  Clear differentiation should be \npromoted between the assessment of risks (using qualitative and It has been clarified that the determination of \nmaterial ESG risks should consider both their \nimpacts on financial risks categories and the \namounts of exposures or revenues exposed \nto the risks.  \nQuantitative information should be used at \nleast for environmental risks.  Section 4.1 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n78 \n \nquantitative views) and risk quantification/measurement (which should be \nbased on a capital or liquidity impact).  \nFor some aspects there are no established calculation methods for \nquantifying, therefore the guidelines should enable qualitative assessment \nwhere appropriate .  \nAsset class \nversus sector \nand geography  A sectoral and geographic classification of portfolio exposures should be \nrequired as part of the materiality assessment of climate -related risks. \nReversely, the traditional classification per asset class should be discouraged, \nas the portfolio vulnerabilities to climate and transition risks depend on the \nsectors and geographies.  It has been further clarified that sectoral and \ngeographic location information should be \ntaken into account as part of materiality \nassessments.  \n Section 4.1 \nclarified  \nE, S, G  E, S and G materiality assessments should not be under similar requirements . \n \nGuidelines should include a reference to nature -related transition and \nphysical risks . More detailed requirements are included for \nE risks. The Guidelines have been amended to \nrefer to exposures towards sectors highly \ndependent on nature and ecosystem \nservices .  Section 4.1 \namended  \nClarification on \nmateriality \nassessment \nperimeter  Guidelines should clarify if portfolio/exposures are encompassed in activities \nas per §14b?  \n \nGuidelines should clarify the materiality assessment for non -UE exposures. It \nis proposed that it is circumscribed in terms of transition risk.  The Guidelines clarify that portfolios are \nencompassed in activities.  \nThe transition risk assessment should take \ninto account exposures’ vulnerabilities to \nrelevant jurisdictions’ objectives.  Section 4.1 \nclarified  \nTime horizons  The m ateriality assessment for the time horizon proposed (including at least \n10 years) is too long to be used for financial resource planning: liquidity \nassessment (including stress testing & planning) focuses on short to medium \nterm risks, making it difficult to cater for long term events; while a capital \nassessment focus (including stress testing and planning) beyond 5 years \nwould not be meaningful.   \nThe business model of a bank when determining the length of the forecast \nhorizon for assessing the materiality of ESG risks should be considered.  \nLong-term time horizon of the materiality assessment should increase to 20 \nyears  or minimum of 25 years to align with transition planning.  See above regarding the clarifications \nprovided in paragraph 19  and below for the \nICAAP section of the Guidelines.  Section 4.2 and \nsection 5.4 \namended  \nMateriality \nassessment Guidelines should elaborate further on the r elationship , synergies and \ndifferences  between the materiality assessment as required under CSRD and The Guidelines have been amended to refer \nto consistency with CSRD and further align Section 4.1 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n79 \n \nconsistency with \nCSRD  EFRAG guide and the materiality assessment as required in the EBA \nguidelines . Guidelines should enable reusing materiality assessment \nperformed under CSRD . Definitions of time horizons should be consistent and \nGuidelines should clarify if severity in §15 is the same as in the ESRS (1§45).  \n§15 likelihood and severity of the materialisation of the risks  should be \nreplaced by likelihood of occurrence and the potential  magnitude of the \nfinancial effects ; to align with CSRD/ESRS  with CSRD and EFRAG implementation \nguidance on the financial materiality \nassessment, including regarding terminology. \nWording of former paragraph 15 has been \naligned.  \n \nDouble \nmateriality  Pros  \nBanks  should also assess how their activities can do more good and less harm \nto the environment in  order to mitigate risks that can be amplified in the \nfinancial system . Guidelines should include requirements on  engagement \nwith affected stakeholders or their representatives  and the assessment of \nthe impact of ESG risks on people and the environment . \nCons  \nGuidelines should clarify that their focus is on financial materiality and the \nmanagement of financial risks to the institution only . It would help banks to \ndeepen their analysis and efforts where the risks are material, in a consistent \nmanner with the risk -based approach.  The Guidelines are focused on financial \nmateriality in line with the nature of the CRD \nbut clarify that adverse impacts should be \ntaken into account to the extent that they \nresult in financial risks and/or reputational, \nlitigation and business model risks.   \n Background \nclarified  \nMore guidance  More detailed guidance or best practice would be welcome  on: likelihood \nregarding ESG risks ; the number and/or which scenario to be used under \n§14c  including their time horizons and  if different scenarios should be \nconsidered across time horizons;  how counterparties are considered “most \ncritical”.   It has been clarified that likelihood refers to \nlikelihood of occurrence, in line with CSRD. \nThe EBA will develop further Guidelines on \nscenario analysis. The reference to most \ncritical counterparties has been removed.  Section 4.1 \namended  \nDivergence of \ncounterparties \nfrom transition \nobjectives  Assessing the divergence of counterparties from transition objectives is too \nprescriptive , too broad for a bank wide materiality analysis  and assumes an \nunproven correlation between transition recalcitrance and the counterparty \nrisk. Institutions should be given the flexibility including making their own \njudgements as to whether counterparty divergence from transition \nobjectives is a releva nt factor.  Banks should not have to rigidly refer to a \ncounterparty ’s alignment with different net -zero pathways to qua ntitatively \nassess financial risk .  The degree of alignment or misalignment of \nportfolios with jurisdictions’ regulatory \nobjectives is an input to materiality \nassessment in particular given its relevance \nto transition planning.  \n Section 4.1 \nslightly \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n80 \n \nLink with \ntransition \nplanning  Materiality should always be a relevant driver for the transition planning \nobligations (i.e., sectors that are not material for the institution ’s business \nmodel and/or capital should not be part of the transition plan) . Transition planning should address material \nESG risks.  \n Section 4.1.and \nsection 6 \nclarified.  \n \nS and G  Guidelines should allow banks to carry out their materiality assessment in a \nway that is proportionate given the lack of clarification from the \nlegislator/regulator on the risks to be precisely regulated. Due to missing \nsocial taxonomy, limitation of the use of S and G data should be more \nemphasized.  See above regarding E versus S and G.

No change  \nICAAP  §18 should be completed to clarify that the banks should justify how criteria \nare weighted relatively to each other. They should also document how they \naddress the data gaps. The corresponding decisions with respect to the \ntreatment of ESG risks should also  be clearly documented, alongside the clear \ninternal definition of materiality, which is already required in the ICAAP \nframework for all risks  relevant to the institution.  It has been further clarified that banks should \nsubstantiate and document their \nassessments and methodologies, including \nthresholds and conclusions.  \n \n Section 4.1 \nclarified.  \n \n \n \n \nNo change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n81 \n \nGuidelines should clarify whether the execution of the reference \nmethodology should be formally in line with the internal mechanisms already \nestablished regarding ICAAP  or should refer only to the materiality of such \nICAAP mechanisms . Additionally, it should be further clarified how to \nentangle these material assessments with other materiality assessments \nconducted by institutions, i.e., whether one or the other (or both) should \ncross -reflect the risk identified in each assessment.  The ESG risks materiality assessments should \nbe consistent with and integrated into other \nassessments such as those made for ICAAP.  \n  \nDisclosure  Transparency and credibility are key in materiality assessments.  Guidelines \nshould include requirements for banks to conduct third -party review and \nconsultation and to disclose all details  regarding its methodologies, \nprocesses and results.  Disclosure is out of scope of these Guidelines \nand covered by other regulations (e.g. Pillar \n3, CSRD).  No change  \n \nQuestion 5: Presumption of materiality for E and  assessment of physical, S and G  risks  \n \nMinimum set of \nexposures (pros)  \n \n Support to the general approach in §16, which is consistent with the climate \nbenchmark regulation  and Pillar 3 template 1 . However, this wide approach \nshould be completed by a more targeted focus on a few critical sectors , coal, \noil, gas. These sectors alone are influential enough to derail the Paris \nAgreement and the EU climate law. In addition, this will ensure more \nconsistency with the CSRD.  In particular exploration of new fossil fuel \nreserves  represent s high transition risk .  \n \nCare should be given to the justification provided for the purpose of §17. It \nis necessary to maintain the requirement for the bank to explain when it \nconsiders that these sectoral exposures are non -material . \n \nGuidelines should further specif y and extend  the list to account for nature -\nrelated risks as well. In the identification of such sectors, it should be built on \nthe extensive body of existing evidence  (in particular, key sectors and \ncompanies have been identified as potentially high risk for deforestation ).  The Guidelines have been amended to \ninclude a reference to exposures towards \nfossil fuel sector entities.  \n \n \n \n \n \nIt has been clarified that conclusions, \nincluding non -materiality ones, should be \nsubstantiated and documented.  \n \nThe Guidelines have clarified that nature \ndegradation and dependencies on ecosystem \nservices should be considered.

Alignment with taxonomy \nshould be 100% otherwise sectors could include activities that do not meet \nthe DNSH criteria hence bear transition risk. The derogation should be \ncomplemented by a second criteria consisting in 100% of the sector/activity \nexposure  to DNSH taxonomy criteria.  \n \nTaxonomy may be used in combination with additional tools (e.g., CPRS , \ncorporate emissions, elements of corporate transition plans ) given the lack \nof information on Taxonomy performance, especially for SMEs .  \n \n'Transitional' activities should be excluded from the derogation  in §17 as \nmedium -to-long -term transition risks carried by associated sectors remain \nhigh . for justifying derogation to presumption of \nmateriality.  \nNon -UE \nexposure \ntreatment  Guidelines should provide flexibility  for group ins titutions based outside the \nEU managing activities outside the EU, such as referring to local taxonomy . \n \nMaking sole reference to the EU Taxonomy as a proxy for non -materially \nwould also pose significant extraterritorial effects for banks with presence in \nthird countries.  \n \nEU taxonomy will not be useful for banks with material exposure outside of \nEU or a portfolio composition with a potential lower share of eligible assets \nfor GAR calculation. Voluntary or internally well justified green assessment \nshould be likewise used for justification, or the materiality assessment will \nnot allow for level playing field with respect to exclusion of exposure as \nmaterially affected.  See below regarding taxonomy -alignment  Section 4.1 \namended  \nMinimum set of \nexposures (cons)  \n More flexibility should be provided as for the sectors to be included in the \nmateriality assessment. D o not support that exposures should automatically \nqualify as materially subject to environmental transition risks on the basis of Institutions should conduct robust \nmateriality assessments that reflect the \nnature, size and complexity of their activities. Section 4.1 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n83 \n \ntheir sector ( §16). This would imply a significant data and assessment burden \neven when it is qualitatively obvious that the NACE sector in question poses \nno environme ntal risks to the firm. The reversal of the burden of proof makes \nthe r isk inventory de facto absurd.  \n \nMateriality categorisation can be  applied e.g. per risk type and only when \ncertain quantitative/qualitative materiality thresholds are reached. The \ncategorisation of certain sectors as material does not automatically mean \nthat they are material from an institution's perspective. Materiality for \ninstitutions depends, among other things, on the business model, risk, \nconcentrations, maturity of the loans, the willingness/possibility of debtor to \nshift its business model, whether the sector itself has the possi bility to \ndecarbonize etc. Therefore, para. 16 and 17 should be removed, and the \napproach to materiality assessment should be left to the discretion of the \ninstitutions . \n \nThe financial materiality and risk -based approach of the prudential \nframework is not necessarily consistent with a purely sector -based approach. \nOther complementary factors will determine the financial materiality of an \nactivity such as the time horizon, th e size of the exposure, the existence of \nmitigation mechanisms, effective transition paths or dedicated financing that \nare in line with an efficient transition, and stress assumptions. While close \nattention is given to high -emitting sectors, the materiali ty assessment should \nbe commensurate to the size, business activity and types of risks carried by \nthe institution.   \n \nSectoral approach including all activities listed in Sections A to H and Section \nL of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2106 is too broad (e.g. insufficient \ndifferentiation at the level of NACE code 1), especially if including the level of \ngranularity as NACE 2 -3-4 digits and does not take into account the \nspecific/idiosyncratic client’s situation. This presumption will impose a  \ndisproportionate do cumentary and audit burden on banks to establish that The final Guidelines have removed the \npresumption of materiality for certain \nsectors considering the limitations of \nautomatically classifying all exposures \ntowards certain sectors as material. \nHowever, the Guidelines require institutions \nto thoroughly asse ss material ESG risks by \ntaking into account a set of criteria and \nexposures, including their exposures towards \nsectors that highly contribute to climate \nchange, with particular consideration given \nto exposures towards fossil fuel sector \nentities . Institut ions are responsible for \nconducting their assessments and should \nsubstantiate and document their \nconclusions, including non -materiality \nconclusions.  \n \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n84 \n \nthe exposure is not material . There will be many exemptions if classifying all \nlisted sectors per se as materially subject to environmental transition risks.  \nThe list should be illustrative in stead of a mandatory. There is also the risk \nthat there is no incentive to investigate exposures to sectors not covered by \nthe predefined list.  \n \nThe list of sectors is not aligned with sectors covered by NZBA targets . This \napproach is also inconsistent with the list of sectors provided by the \nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) for their Net -Zero Emissions (NZE) \nscenarios, well -recognised and adopted globally, as the activities in sections \nE, F and G are not included in t he IEA NZE.  \nUse of taxonomy \n(cons)  The reference to the EU Taxonomy for the exclusion of some sectorial \nactivities should be removed : assess ing Taxonomy alignment even when it is \nclear that the exposure is not relevant an d/or immaterial is too burdensome; \nhigh level of alignment is too ambiguous; t axonomy -eligible portion in the \nbanking book is very small  as benchmarks have shown for many banks . \n \nThe mere alignment to the EU taxonomy does not directly imply less ESG risk \nas the EU taxonomy regulation classifies the activities as green not from a \nrisk-based perspectiv e and the EU Taxonomy framework is not designed as a \nrisk management tool.  There is to date no evidence of a generalized positive \nrisk differential according to green v s. brown  features of counterparty \nactivities.  \n \nEU Taxonomy does not have a full coverage of all activities, some \ncounterparties are not subject to it due to their sizes, there are products \noutside the taxonomy (e.g. SLN) with objectives to facilitate/enhance \ncounterparties’ transition efforts that are not captured by the taxonomy. The \ntaxonomy operates as a classification tool at the activity level, not at the \nsectoral level .  In light of the removal of the presumption of \nmateriality for certain sectors and the \nlimitations of taxonomy -alignment from a \nfinancial risk assessment perspective, the \nparagraph outlining derogation options has \nbeen deleted.  \n Section 4.1 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n85 \n \nSimilar \nrequirements for \nS, G, physical \n(cons)  Similar requirements should not be provided : social and governance risks are \nnot comparable as a transmission channel of financial risk to environmental \nrisks. It would be disproportionate to include them in the same manner. \nSocial and governance risks are more related to client -idiosyncrasy. Trying to \nbuild a risk -assessment system or metrics for governance or social risks \nwould be extremely burdensome and would not be supported by a \ncost/benefit analysis.  \nGiven the difficulties stemming from the identification of transition risk, it is \nunclear that a similar approach would provide better results on other type of \nrisks (physical, social, governance ). The materiality assessment for social, \ngovernance, biodiversity risks should be done on a best effort basis at this \nstage .  The Guidelines contain more detailed \nrequirements for the materiality assessment \nof E risks.  \n No change  \nSimilar \nrequirements for \nS, G (pros)  Guidelines should provide similar approach / requirements by consistently \nrequiring 1/ use of qualitative and quantitative data, 2/ a risk -based approach \nto take into account likelihood and severity of the materialization of the risks.  \n \nGuidelines should provide equivalent requirements for biodiversity risk, in \nparticular deforestation. Biodiversity loss and deforestation pose significant \nenvironmental risks and have far -reaching social and governance \nimplications, including impacts on local communities, indigenous rights, and \nsupply chain integrity.  Nature -related risks financial impact on individual \nbanks has been well -documented . \n \nGuidelines should provide a  minimum set of exposures to be considered as \nmaterial for each type of risk - environmental (E), social (S), and governance \n(G). However, it is essential to recognise that materiality may vary depending \non the context and nature of each financial institution's operations.  \n \nGuidelines should extend the list to sectors A to U, as they involve risks from \nthird parties (data processing including data centers, information and \ncommunication) on the physical, social and governance risks sides.

A \npossible way to integrate this as part of the present guidelines is to require \nthat the banks update their list of mandatory material exposures on physical \nrisks continuously according to public recommendations . \nA minimum list of physical risk hazards that are generally considered as \n\"material\" by geographical area - in example NUTS3 level would be helpful \nfor the institution to evaluate the coverage of its own physical risk \nassessment framework.  The Guidelines require institutions to take \ninto account the geographical areas in which \nkey assets of counterparties or physical \ncollateral, in particular for real estate \nexposures, is located . There is no mandatory \nlist of exposures for physical risks, but \ninstitutions are responsible for conducting \nrobust assessments by using both qualitative \nand quantitative information and considering \na sufficiently large scope of environmental \nfactors.

Points i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, ix of the list are particularly relevant to \nassess the ESG risk profile of counterparties.  \n \nSome data points should be made more prescriptive : \n• Current and forecasted greenhouse gas (GHG) scope 1, 2 and 3 emis-\nsions in both absolute and intensity terms.  \n• Investment (capex) in fossil fuels, split between investment in exist-\ning infrastructures and new ones, and operational expenses (opex) \nrelated to fossil fuel consumption and/or infrastructures.

Institutions should determine which data \npoints they will collect for retail \ncounterparties by considering the list \nprovided in the guidelines, which includes \nclimate related factors.  Section 4.2.2 \nclarified  \nTransition plans  Pros  \nStrong support  to the recognition of the counterparties ’ transition plans as a \nrelevant source of forward -looking information for financial institutions ’ risk \nassessments. Once the transition plans in the non -financial sector are \nstreamlined and made credible via the assurance function, such transition \nplans offer themselves as a credible and comparable source of information, \nwhich should contribute to the  convergence of views on transition risk \namong financial institutions . \nCons  \nDo not support the obligation to use data from transition plans to assess \nlarge companies, particularly as there is no obligation to prepare such plans \nunder the CSRD.  The Guidelines have kept the transition plans \nas one of the data points that institutions \nshould consider given their ability to inform \nthe forward -looking risk assessment of \ncounterparties.  \n \n \n \n \nWording has been clarified to refer to plans \ndisclosed in accordance with CSRD, when \navailable.  No change  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 4.2.2 \nclarified  \nConsistency with \nCSRD  The list of data to be collected from counterparties listed in §23 should be \nprimarily focused on data being published under CSRD , which has set up an \nextensive reporting framework for ESG data that is quite unique at \ninternational level, attempting to calibrate the reporting burden of \ncompanies and the need for ESG data.  \nData requirement should not go beyond what is required by CSRD  and \nfurther align : emissions targets instead of forecasts, dependence of natural \nresources rather than on fossil fuels, risk of litigation not requested by CSRD .  \nTiming of requirements of the guidelines should be consistent with that of \ndisclosure under CSRD so banks can build out their data systems to house a \nvariet y of non -financial datapoints f rom their clients and counterparties .  The list of data is focused on data large \ncorporates will have to disclose under CSRD. \nAlignment has been reinforced for example \nto refer to targets instead of forecasts. \nAlthough disclosure of litigation cases is not \nrequested under CSRD, this informs the  risk \nassessment institutions should perform and \nthis has been moved to section 4.2.3.  \nThe Guidelines apply from 2026 or, for SNCI, \n2027, allowing to make use of CSRD data to a \nlarge extent.  Section 4.2 \namended.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n88 \n \nClient \nengagement \ncompared with \nCSRD  Guidelines should provide some clarification on the extent to which it is \nneeded to engage with counterparts beyond the publicly available ESG data \nthey provide.  Client engagement should not be made necessary if primary \ndata is publicly available under CSRD. S ome Member States appear to have \nasked financial institutions to limit bilateral outreach to corporates to collect \ndata and rely as much as possible on data reported from CSRD and from data \nproviders. This goes against the requirements from the Guideli nes to \nprimarily engage with clients to collect data. Counterparties  might face \nmultiple asks from different banks at a time when they are deploying huge \neffort to produce CSRD data .   The Guidelines require institutions to build \non available ESG data, and to assess which \nother sources of data would effectively \nsupport the identification of ESG risks, such \nas information captured through \nengagement.  Section 4.2.2 \nclarified  \nFlexibility with \nrespect to data \nto collect  Data collection may prove to be very difficult, as banks  will have to look \nthrough a large number of counterparties with which they can be engaged \nwith .  \nThe list of data to be collected for large corporate counterparties should be \nindicative (or seen as recommendation) only as it does not depend on \nmateriality analysis and does not include a proportionality approach based \non the type of service offered to these customers . \nCounterparty data gathering  (including for large corporate counterparties)  \nshould be based upon a materiality assessment of the risk of the \ncounterparty , ESG risks identified, the type of clients, collateral and \nexposures, etc.  Data requirements should be determined using a risk -based \napproach as some data points are more important to assess risk in certain \nsectors . The list of data points has been maintained \nbut it has been clarified that institutions \nshould consider obtaining or collecting this \nlist, with a view to ensuring they have \nappropriate information to assess ESG risks. \nData processes should also be develope d \ntaking into account the outcomes of the \nmateriality assessment, as clarified by \nparagraph 17.  \n Section 4.2.2 \namended  \nPara 24  Guidelines should set a baseline for ESG -related data collection for non -large \ncounterparties, to ensure a minimal level of data collection across \ninstitutions . \nAs per the EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring §126, \ninstitutions may conduct portfolio -based evaluations for micro/small \nenterprises instead of borrower -specific assessments. This regulation is \nsensible as it reduces the burden on micro and small enterprises . Such \napproach should be foreseen in §24.  Given data availability, the baseline is set for \nlarge corporates counterparties, but \ninstitutions should consider the list provided \nfor those counterparties when determining \ndata points needed for other counterparties. \nSee also below on exposure -based met hod \nfor SMEs.  Section 4.2.2 \nclarified  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n89 \n \nPara 25  Guidelines should clarify expectations around the timeframe for reducing \nreliance on proxies, and quality assurance for data procured from third party \nproviders.  \nGuidelines should ensure the phase -out of proxies to help fill data gaps by \nspecifying the exact timeline for doing so: 3 to 5 years maximum are \nrecommended.    No specific timeframe is included in the \nGuidelines but institutions should \nprogressively seek to reduce use of proxies \nand improve practices and data quality.  No change  \nData gaps  More guidance is expected to address data gaps. Data gap may increase for \nthe banks to assess ESG risks  as the EC is proposing to increase the threshold \nfor corporations to be c onsidered SMEs. It might reduce the scope of the \ncorporations under the CSRD.  \nGuidelines should stress that missing data or difficulties resolving gaps \nshould not discourage banks from integrating these ESG risks and that \ninstitutions should take precautionary measures.  The EBA notes that efforts are ongoing to \naddress ESG data gaps in the EU. Institutions \nshould leverage on these developments and \nassess remaining gaps and document \nremediating actions.  No change  \nUse of proxies  Pros  \nThe use of proxies throughout the guidelines should be revised. T he \ncollection of ESG data is still very challenging, with multiple issues ranging \nfrom comparability of data to coverage of data.  Some se ctions of the \nguidelines  give the impression that the use of estimated values and proxies \nis an inferior method. However, proxies can generally represent a good and \njustifiable measure, particularly in the volume business, and need not be \ninferior to the quality of raw data. Ulti mately, proxies also serve to avoid \noverburdening small companies and private customers. The use of proxies \nshould therefore generally be made possible for all companies.   \nCons  \nProxies have some limitations such as being difficult to use in risk \nmanagement functions; they are based on averages; they consider that all \ncompanies in a given sector are similar or they might have a limited time \nhorizon . \nThe use of estimates and/or proxies can only be contemplated as a last \nresort, and that both the choice to use them (lack of data or unreliable data) \nand the choice of a certain estimate and/or proxy instead of others must be \njustified.  The Guidelines do not prevent the use of \nproxies but request institutions to make use \nof available data and assess which other \nsources may be useful. Proxies can represent \nan alternative to raw data in certain cases but \nalso present limitations which justi fy efforts \nby institutions to seek to gradually reduce \ntheir use.  \n Section 4.2.2 \nclarified  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n90 \n \nGuidance and \nsupport needed  Guidelines  should clarify how institutions should use proxies and estimates \nin the case of data unavailability.  \nGuidance would be expected  on which sources or proxies can be used  for \nsocial and governance risk . The choice of specific proxies and estimates \nis the responsibility of institutions who \nshould document and justify their choices.  No change  \nData providers  The data providers are not only used to obtain estimates  when data is not \ndirectly available from the counterparts,  but also to optimize the collection \nof the data from corporates even where those data are publicly available \n(avoiding the need for institutions to examine each of sustainability report of \nthousands of entities). Hence, using data providers should be left to the \ninstitutions in a consistent manner with the outsourcing framework.  \nGuidelines should provide that banks rely on the data quality assurance of \nthe data provider and make that an important criterion in the vendor \nevaluation process; the vendor should check the quality of its data and it \nshould be select ed based on data quality.  \nRequirements to verify the quality of the data will place on banks a \nresponsibility and a cost of resources that is not proportionate to the role of \nthe banks : data subject to external audit should be presumed of high quality. \nNon -audited data which are provided by the company should also be \npresumed to be reliable, except in the case of obvious inconsistency or public \ncontroverses.  \nGuidelines  should clarify how , in what context, for what purpose  data from \nexternal parties can be used. The Guidelines have been amended to clarify \nthat i nstitutions should assess which sources \nof data would effectively support the \nidentification of ESG risks . Using data \nproviders is not prohibited but, in line with \nsound governance and outsourcing practices, \nwhen institutions use services of third -party \nproviders they  should ensure sufficient \nunderstanding of the sources, data and \nmethodologies used by data providers.  \nInstitutions  should  also have in place \narrangements to assess and improve quality  \nof data used .  \n Section 4.2.2 \nclarified  \nClarification \nneeds  §23aiii. “Material” is not defined and could imply different \nassumption/interpretation among financial institutions. W ho assess es that \nimpacts are material ? Should it l everage more explicitly on CSRD?  \n§23aix. “ Adaptive capacity ” should be clarified , as adaptation is typically used \nin the context of climate physical risk, but here seems to refer to company \ntransition plans. These topics require different datasets, and further \nclarification could help avoid confusion.  A materiality assessment has to be \nperformed under CSRD. Banks may rely on \nthat assessment or decide to challenge it. No \nchange.  \nWording has been clarified and ‘adaptive \ncapacity’ removed.  \n Section 4.2.2 \nclarified  \nDrafting \nsuggestions  §20-21-25. The use of ESG risk -related data / ESG data / ESG profile / ESG risk \nprofile should be harmonized  to avoid misunderstandings.  Wording has been harmoni sed to refer to \nESG risk -related data or ESG data.  Section 4.2.2 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n91 \n \n§21. Should be amended so that ins titutions should be allowed to efficiently \ndesign data processes based on the relevance of business activities in \nrelation to all risk types and the results of the materiality analysis.  \n§23 could be amended to avoid the reference to generic statements such as \n“Governance practices ”, and point to more specific frameworks . \n§23.a.i. Regarding the collection of geographical location of key assets, we \nrecommend that, at a minimum, longitude and latitude coordinates, \naddresses, square meters, and building type should be collected.  \n§23. a.ii. Inconsistency with §94.a . where the metric is in absolute terms only. \nDue to known weaknesses of “monetary intensity” it is proposed to reshape \nthis requirement and  make a hierarchy of metrics).  The intensity approach, \nwhether promoted or accepted by SBTi and many industry alliances, does not \nreflect the fact that global warming is fed by actual emissions, not intensity, \ngiving a false impression of progress towards a carbon neutral economy and \nmaking targets easier to reach. GHG emission reduction targets should at \nleast be expre ssed in absolute amounts.  \n§23.a.iii.  and v. should be deleted. Institutions and supervisory authorities \nare in no position to judge or disincentivize environmental impact, as long as \nsuch impact is legitimate by law and does not constitute financial risk (e.g. \nGHG certificate prices) relevant for de fault risk. The mere fact of resource \nconsumption, as long as legitimate under the law, does not constitute a \nfinancial ESG risk factor from any institution ’s point of view.  \n§23.a.vi. More specific metrics should be provided as EPC is not yet \nstandardized.  \n§23.a.vii. Requirements for institutions should expand to report on their \nalignment with specific regulatory and framework disclosures, such as the \nCSRD and the Taskforce on Nature -related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) . \n§23.a.vii. The adherence to voluntary or mandatory climate and \nenvironmental reporting (point vii) will also not say much about the actual \nlevel of ESG risk exposure of the counterparty.  \n§23.a.viii. T he inclusion of litigation risks  may not be practical in all cases. \nDetailed information on imminent or pending litigation is likely to be Data processes should be proportionate to \nmateriality assessments.  \n \nRequirements have been amended to align \nwith the Taxonomy and CSRD.  \nBanks could decide to collect these data but \nthe general requirement is to collect data \nenabling physical risk analysis.  \nGuidelines now align with CSRD (absolute \nvalue and where relevant intensity).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdverse impacts and dependence on natural \nresources may result into financial risks.  \n \n \n \n \nEPC has been removed.  \n \nThe Guidelines do not address disclosure \nrequirements for institutions.  \n \nThis data item has been deleted.  \n \n \nThe assessment of litigation risk should \nsupport the risk identification and \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n92 \n \nrestricted, and gaining sufficient information to determine the relevance, \nimpact and likelihood of outcomes from a litigation will prove extremely \ndifficult. § should be amended to include “where available”.  An imminent \nlitigation risk of the counterparty is likely to be provisioned by the \ncounterparts. Hence, this consideration may lead to a double counting in the \ncredit risk associated with this counterparty.  \n§23.a.ix. Note that CSRD is a disclosure directive and does not require \npreparing a transition plan. § should be amended accordingly.  \n§23.a. x. (new)  third party assessments performed regarding environmental \nperformance, notably credibility and robustness of corporate transition plans . \nAs transition plan content is highly complex information, leveraging on third \nparty assessment should be a useful source of information in order to avoid \nunnecessary burde n. \n§23.b.ii. More guidance is needed regarding governance practices. For \ninstance, different categories of governance practices could be defined. This \nwould make the assessment of different institutions ’ exposures to \ngovernance risk more understandable and comparable.  \n23.b.iv.  should be deleted. ESG risk factors are only to be taken into account \nin exceptional cases where local circumstances are such that lawsuits against \ninstitutions or their clients are evidently imminent and could put the \ncreditworthiness of borrowers at ris k. But this is so rare that the wording of \nitem (iv) seems much too vague to capture it. Moreover, it i s already covered \nby item (v).  \n§23.b.i -v.

SNCI should \nbe excluded from §23b.  \nThe Guidelines should aim to provide additional guidance to SNCIs with \nlimited data for their assessment of financial impacts stemming from ESG \nfactors . SNCIs should also develop sound data \nprocesses but may implement less complex \narrangements in line with the general \nproportionality approach.  \n No change  \nCSDDD  Guidelines should clarif y how the data collection requirements relate to the \ndue diligence requirements laid down in the CSDDD. S ocial fac tors and data \non due diligence should be introduced progressively, in consistent manner \nwith CSDDD,  which only covers entities over 1000 employees, and which \nincludes a review clause of 2 years for the application to financial services . The requirements in the Guidelines may \nsupport the implementation of CSDDD or \nleverage on due diligence procedures \nperformed by counterparties.  \n No change  \nData sources  Institutions may consider below data sources: forests finance, Global Oil Gas \nExit list, ENCORE.  Institutions should build on available data \nand assess data quality.  No change  \nData quality  Guidelines should set clear standards for the quality and integrity of the ESG \ndata collected. This guidance should mirror the specificity found in \nframeworks such as the PCAF's guidance on greenhouse gas emissions \nensuring institutions can rely on high -quality, relevant data for risk \nassessments and decision -making.  The Guidelines request banks to review their \npractices regularly and improve data quality.  \n No change  \n \nQuestion 7: Measurement and assessment principles  \n \nMore guidance \nneeded on S&G \nrisks  Excessive focus on environmental issues.  \nThe EBA should  provide guidance/requirements in terms of quantification for \nsocial and governance risks.  See above regarding the emphasis put on E. \nBanks should progressively enhance \npractices towards quantification for S and G.  No change  \nPara. 26a  \nSingle -name \ninformation and \nmapping  The EBA should clarify that institutions are expected to use analytical models \nthat overcome sectoral approaches  being able to evaluate single -name \ninformation.  A combination of methodologies should be \nused, including at exposure level.  \n No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n94 \n \nMapping of exposures to individual risk drivers would be extremely \nchallenging and would represent questionable benefit in terms of risk \nmanagement information versus the effort/ cost involved for institutions.  \nThis mapping should be restricted to economically material exposures.  Not every exposure needs to be mapped \nagainst all risk drivers but tools should allow \nto assess transmission of ESG risks drivers to \nfinancial risks.  \nPara. 26b  \nESG risk \nconcentration  ESG risk concentration  is not yet defined in regulation and implies first \nidentification and evaluation of ESG risk. Ask for flexibility in the \nmeasurement of concentration risk.  \nCall for a gradual implementation of this approach and to keep consistency \nwith other concentration risk related initiatives in Pillar 1 and 2.  See below regarding concentration risk.  \n \n \n No change  \nProportionality \nand use of the \nthree methods  Support for the broad range of methods.  \nRequest for flexibility/discretion  in the use of the three methods and \nproportionality in the application of them.  The range of methods has been kept. They \nshould be applied taking into account the \nmateriality assessment.  No change  \nPara. 27  \nClarification on \nuse of three \nmethods  Request for further clarification about which particular methodology \nresponds to which particular risk management need  and how the three \nmethodologies complement each other, how institutions can use different \nmethodologies for different portfolios and what are the expectations \nregarding forward -looking measurement methods and what are the \ndifferences between portfolio and  scenario -based methodologies.  The structure of section 4.2 has been \nchanged to clarify key principles for \nmeasurement and assessment methods first. \nParagraph 30  specifies how the methods \nshould be applied for complementary time \nhorizons and purposes. Portfolio -based \nmethodologies rely on scenarios but should \nbe complemented by other types of scenario \nanalyses, which will be specified by the EBA \nin complementary G uidelines.  Section 4.2 \namended  \nSpecify baseline \ncriteria ESG risk \nmeasurement  The integration of forward -looking scenarios, especially concerning \nenvironmental risks, enables institutions to gauge potential future states and \nadjust their strategies accordingly. While the EBA's approach is \ncomprehensive, an alternative could involve specifying baseline quantitative \ncriteria for ESG risk measurement to ensure consistency across institutions.  The Guidelines specify criteria for exposure -\nbased methods. The EBA will also issue \nGuidelines on climate scenario analysis.  \n No change  \nAllow use of \nqualitative \ninstruments \n(esp. SME)  Institutions should be allowed to put more focus on qualitative tools,  e.g. \nquestionnaires.  \nEBA should welcome the possibility of using qualitative data, especially for \ncounterparties with limited data (e.g., SMEs).  Increased flexibility has been incorporated in \nthe Guidelines regarding assessment of ESG \nrisks for non -large corporate counterparties, \nincluding use of portfolio -based assessments, \nproxies and qualitative data where needed.  Section 4.2.2 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n95 \n \nInstead of (indirectly) obliging SMEs to collect data, all banks and companies \ninvolved should be allowed to use estimated values and proxies . This could \nbe in the form of portfolio -based assessments instead of borrower -specific \nassessments, or sector data.   \nPara. 27 \nPortfolio \nalignment \nmethodology  Portfolio alignment methodologies not considered as relevant, but seen as, \nmostly, an artificial level of technical complexity highly model -dependent.  To \nsome extent, one could consider that collective metrics performed at an \neconomically sound perimeter (such for instance as a value chain or a \nsectoral -based perimeter ) might bear some relevance . Portfolio alignment \nmetrics  should only complement  other approaches.  See below regarding portfolio alignment \nmethods.  No change  \nPara. 27  \nSector -based \napproach  While portfolio alignment tools are useful to provide the “big picture ”, they \ncannot provide sufficient granularity alone to inform and shift the decision -\nmaking process at sector and asset level. For that purpose, sector -specific \nanalysis is necessary for the key sectors.  A key entry point for banks is sector -\nspecific finance (mortgages for buildings; infrastructure finance; energy \nfinance; shipping finance, etc).  The Guidelines clarify that institutions should \nuse sector -based methods as part of their \nrange of methods.  \n Guidelines and \nsection 4.2.3 \nclarified  \nQuantification \nand probability \nof \nmaterialization  It is unrealistic to require banks to quantify probabilities and consequences \nof environmental risks.  \nEBA should clarify that both physical and transition risk should be included \nand own models should be allowed to be used.  Quantification of E in particular climate -\nrelated risks is important for sound risk \nmanagement. Both physical and transition \nrisks form part of E.  No change  \nPara. 28 KRIs  EBA should define specific guidance on what specific KRIs institutions should \nestablish for the measurement of ESG risks.  A KRI -list with examples is useful \n(e.g., transition: green asset ratio, scope 1,2,3 emissions, alignment \nmeasures per sector).  \nLimit KRIs to large corporates (para 23)  A list of metrics is included under section 5.7 \nof the Guidelines and can support institutions \nin the determination of appropriate KRIs, \ncovering a scope of exposures consistent \nwith the outcomes of the materiality \nassessment.  No change  \nPara. 29  \n Forward -looking assessment is difficult at this point and building scenario \nanalysis methodology will take time. In future guidelines it would be \nadvisable to include specific guidance on how to combine top -down and \nbottom -up scenarios . The EBA will issue Guidelines on climate \nscenario analysis.  \n \n \n No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n96 \n \nIt would be useful that regulatory expectations around measurement are \nframed recognizing those limitations and acknowledging that banks will have \nto take simplistic projection assumptions when going beyond three years.  See above regarding clarification provided on \ntime horizons.  \nDue diligence  Institutions should commit to performing due diligence to gather \ncomprehensive data on ESG risks . This involves collecting information \ndirectly from counterparties and utilising data from diverse sources such as \nNGOs, governments, and civil society organisations.  See above regarding data processes.  Section 4.2.2 \namended  \nAsset -level \napproach  EBA should integrate an asset -level approach for activities that bear a \nparticularly high transition risk,  such as fossil fuel extraction facilities, or \nfossil -fuel fired power plants  Asset -level data is mentioned in the section \non data processes. See also above on \nmateriality assessment.  No change  \n \nQuestion 8 : Exposure -based methodology  \n \nSupport  General support for use of the three methods . Support for the requirements \nfor the exposure -based methodology  Exposure -based methods are part of the final \nGuidelines.  No change  \nRequest for \ndiscretion for the \nuse of methods  Clarify i n paragraphs 30 to 33 that institutions have discretion as to design \nappropriate methodologies i.e. a principle -based approach.  \nThe exposure -based method should be subject to materiality assessment in \n4.1.  Institutions should design methods by \ncomplying with the Guidelines and apply \nthem subject to materiality. See also above \non materiality.  No change  \nUse more \nmethods  The exposure -based method should be complemented by other tools, such \nas stress testing, scenario analysis and qualitative assessments.   A range of methods is requested including \nscenario -based methods.  No change  \nPara. 30  \n \nConcerns about \nmandatory \nintegration ESG \naspects into PD \nmodelling  Integration of ESG aspects into PD modelling is challenging due to data \nunavailability, lack of evidence and the potential technical unsoundness, \nparticularly when considering the long -term impact of E -factors. It would be \npremature to modify credit scorin g or rating models.  \nIt is assumed that banks are not obliged to incorporate ESG risks into their \nrating models, provided that an existing ESG score covers all E, S, and G \ncomponents and is used as a decision criterion during the lending process. \nRequest for further clarificat ion.  Institutions should ensure that ESG factors, in \nparticular environmental factors,  are taken \ninto account in the overall assessment of \ndefault risk of a borrower and, where \njustified  by their materiality , embedded in  \nthe scoring or rating models . \n No change  \nPara. 30  \nNeed for \nadjustments in Question if a dedicated DoD definition related to ESG risk drives is needed.  \nIntroduce a shadow PD factoring in climate -related financial risks.  Modifications in the Pillar 1 prudential \nframework are out of scope of the \nGuidelines. This is covered by EBA report of No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n97 \n \nprudential \nframework  The prudential framework should be adjusted to allow for larger weight of \nforward -looking assessments.  \nIntroduce pragmatic solution such as the margin of conservatism or a \ndownturn component.  October 2023 and upcoming reports under \nCRR3.  \n \nPara. 30  \nUse of \nscores/expert \njudgements  Give institutions flexibility to rely on existing ESG scores used as decision \ncriterion in the lending process or expert judgements/overrides.  Institutions should design and use tools as \nspecified by the Guidelines. See also \nclarification on the assessment of each \ncategory of risk.  No change  \nMake \nrequirements \ndiscretionary  Regarding the risk factors and criteria, change “at least’ into “where \napplicable”  or alike, as the list is not relevant for all exposures and sets \nrequirement regardless of portfolio materiality.  Where applicable was already included. The \nmethod should be applied subject to \nmateriality.  No change  \nPara. 31(a)(b)  \nDegree of \nvulnerability  Support for consideration vulnerability.  \nClarify what is meant by ‘the degree of vulnerability’  in 31(a)(b).  \nDo not limit ‘degree of vulnerability’ to new technical developments (e.g., \ncarbon capture projects).  The degree of vulnerability should be \nassessed by institutions taking into account \nthe factors listed in the Guidelines.  No change  \nOn- and off -\nbalance sheet  Support EBA’s approach to cover both on - and off -balance sheet activities.  \nRequest that this should be made clear through the whole GL.  CRD and the Guidelines require institutions \nto have risk management processes \ncomprehensive and proportionate to the \nnature, scale and complexity of the ir \nactivities .  No change  \nPara. 31b  \n The EBA should ensure that GHG -emissions are analysed in absolute and \nintensity terms.   \nPara. 31b should be amended as to clarify that GHG emissions as such are \nnot a risk driver, as long as they are legitimate under the law, and as long as \nGHG certificate prices do not contribute to the underlying businesses risk of \ndefault.  \nThe analysis should be completed by the level of alignment of counterparties \nwith the Paris objectives.  \nInclude scenario analysis in the evaluation of mortgage collateral.  See above – alignment with CSRD.  \n \nGHG emissions are not a direct predictor of \nfinancial risk but should be taken into \naccount in the risk assessment.  \n \nSee portfolio alignment method.  \n \nBanks should use scenario -based tools.  Section 4.2.3 \namended  \nPara. 31b  \nConsideration of \ntransition plans  EBA should include transition plans and the credibility and robustness of \ntransition plans of the counterparty to mitigate these risks in para. 31b.  Transition plans are part of the risk mitigating \nfactors banks should take into account as \nclarified in paragraph 32.  Section 4.2.3 \nclarified  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n98 \n \nTransition plans/objectives are important and given the drawbacks of the \nprudential framework (backward -looking; data limitations etc.), EBA is \nencouraged to work with other EU/international supervisors towards a \ncommon baseline approach to transition risk analyses and measurement .  \nPara. 31c  \nDifficulties with \ninclusion of \nsupply -chain  Concerns about the inclusion of the supply chain. Request for clarification of \nwhat is expected. Proportionality of the institutions and the counterparty \nshould be considered. One respondent asks to only ask broad questions \nabout the supply chain.  \nInformation required should not go beyond the CSRD. It should be made \nexplicit that the supply chain is not the responsibility of the bank; reference \nis made to the CSDDD where the downstream value chain of financial \ninstitutions is out of scope.  \nSome respondents note ‘likelihood’ estimation of critical disruptions to the \nbusiness model/supply chain would remain complex in the near future and \nthe supply chain element is too far -reaching and not manageable.   \nOne respondent asks to change ‘likelihood of critical disruptions’ into \n‘exposure to critical disruptions’ to maintain flexibility.  To properly assess ESG risks at the exposure \nlevel banks should understand if the business \nmodel or supply chain of the counterparty \ncould be affected by critical disruptions due \nto ESG factors. This is without prejudice to \nthe application of CSDDD and for ms part of \nsound risk management. The wording has \nbeen amended to refer to exposures to \ncritical disruptions.  \n \n \n \n Section 4.2.3. \namended  \n \nPara. 31c  \n Currently there are no market standards or science based initiatives which \nprovide such reliable impact assessment of biodiversity loss, water stress or \npollution .

Risk mitigating factors including insurance \nand transition plans are part of the factors \nbanks should consider when assessing ESG \nrisks at exposure level, as clarified in \nparagraph 32 . \n Section 4.2.3 \nclarified  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n99 \n \nIt is important that banks who are not in the first line, could deduct the \ninsured portion of their loans and only keep the residual one when assessing \ntheir materiality.  \nPara. 32  \nEngagement \nwith small \ncounterparties  Difficulties of meeting the requirements in para. 32 re. the engagement with \nsmaller counterparties to obtain data.  \nRequest for additional considerations and simplifications for SMEs, e.g., to \nuse portfolio -based valuation methods like in the EBA GLOM, or the use \nproxies on portfolio level, expert judgement or data vendors.  \nData collection should only be done in the onboarding process to avoid \nburden for the bank and SME later. Respect principle of proportionality.  \nUnder no circumstances should the data requirements to be provided to \nSMEs exceed those in the reporting standard of the voluntary reporting \nstandard for SMEs (VSME).  \nThe issues posed around obtaining useful vendor data would make it \nnecessary for the EBA to clarify and possibly narrow its definition of \ncounterparty to allow for institutions to be able to fulfil the requirements.

Institutions should perform due diligence to \nassess financial risks stemming from S and G \nfactors. This should be done by taking into \naccount outcomes of materiality assessment.  Section 4.2.3 \nclarified.  \nPara. 33  \n It is not clear how S&G factors would drive prudential risk aside from certain \nsevere scenarios – therefore we believe that institutions should be allowed \nto make their own assessment of the relevance of these factors to their risk \nmanagement.  Institutions should assess potential financial \nrisks linked with S and G factors.  Section 4.2.3 \nclarified.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n100 \n \nPara. 33  Include that institutions can consider sector and count ry risk levels on social \nand governance matters as a way to assess exposure when limited \ncounterparty data is available.

Due diligence on clients is part of banks’ risk \nmanagement, in line with materiality and \nproportionality considerations.  \n No change  \nConsideration of \nsocial and \ngovernance risk  \nPara. 33  The evaluation of a counterparty's social and governance risks should extend \nbeyond merely checking its compliance with international standards. It \nshould also encompass an assessment of the effectiveness of the strategies \nimplemented by the counterparty to mitigate these risks.  Institutions should assess financial risks \ntaking into account adherence to social and \ngovernance standards.  \n Section 4.2.3 \nclarified  \n \nQuestion 9: Portfolio alignment methodologies  \n \n \n \nAlignment with \nother European \nregulatory \ninitiatives  EBA should  work with other EU supervisory authorities , as well as non -\nfinancial authorities, to establish a set of scenarios for common use, as well \nas encourage further cross -institutional work on the sufficiently granular \nregional and sectoral pathways . \nConnect the sectoral portfolio alignment guidelines to the PiT distance to the \nIEA NZ 2050 scenario disclosed in the Pillar 3 ESG Templates.  Profit from  \nNACE code -level  information, to  connect the misalignment of exposures to \nthese sectors, depending on the level of alignment (or non -alignment) of the \nrelevant exposures to the EU taxonomy.  The EBA will issue Guidelines on climate \nscenario analysis. See also below on the \nchoice of scenarios.  \n \nThe Guidelines have been kept high -level; the \n(mis)alignment may be expressed  in terms of \npoint in time distance in percentage points.  No change.  \nTransition risk  Alignment only means a lower risk if the economy gradually transforms \ntowards CO2 neutrality.  If this does not happen and the world remains in a \nhot house world scenario, sustainable exposures could even be riskier.  \nThe financial impacts analysis should take into account both Net Zero \nscenarios and \"most probable\" scenarios that Banks seek as appropriate in Banks should assess ESG risks based on a \nrange of scenarios. The Guidelines include \nportfolio alignment methods as one of the \ntools banks should use to assess climate \ntransition risks, and will be complemented by No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n101 \n \norder to perform sensitivity analysis related to the impacts stemming from \nsetting Net Zero target strategies when the economy is not moving towards \na Net Zero direction .

In a perspective of \naligning portfolios with the climate target, the regulator could clearly define \nthe criteria that banks must consider in the loan origination process.  The Guidelines do not address supervisory \nmeasures but explain how institutions should \nconsider insights from alignment \nassessments.  No change  \nPara. 34  \n \nFocus should be \non sector -level.  EBA should  dismiss portfolio -based methodologies and rather use asset -level \nassessment. To some extent sectoral -based metrics could be considered,  \nleveraging notably on existing transition scenario trajectories and sectoral \nobjectives . Portfolio -level metrics could encourage to finance climate -\nneutral sectors instead of facilitating the transition.  \nEither make explicit that portfolio -based methodologies must include sector -\nbased methodologies, or add a fourth level with sector -based \nmethodologies.  It has been clarified that the section deals \nwith sector -based methods, portfolio -based \nand portfolio alignment methods. In \nparticular alignment assessments should be \nconducted on a sectoral basis.  \n Section 4.2.3 \nclarified  \nPara. 34  \nBank’s discretion \nin ESG risk \nmanagement is \nnot prescribing \nportfolio \nalignment  Absent firm -level net -zero requirements  (EU Climate Law holds for Member \nStates) , why should  be banks required to factor climate -related portfolio \nalignment into their risk management practice ? Firms may choose to shift \nthe composition of their portfolio away from certain exposures/sectors to \nreduce transition risk, but they may equally decide to adopt other risk \nmanagement strategies  that allow them to retain their existing portfolio \nbalance (e.g. through other hedging strategies).  The Guidelines do not prescribe an alignment \nstrategy. Institutions should decide which \nstrategy they pursue. Portfolio alignment \nassessments should be taken into account in \nthis process given insights provided into \nexposure to climate transition risks.  \n Section 4.2.3 \nclarified  \nPara. 34  \nScience -based \nmethodologies  We recommend specifying that while the banks may choose appropriate \nmethodologies, these should be science -based.  Caution regarding implied \ntemperature alignment methodologies from third -party vendors, which \nshould follow appropriate data and model risk management processes.  Focus of the section is not on implied \ntemperature alignment at the institution’s \nlevel but on assessment at the sector level, \nincluding through reference to science -based \nscenarios.  Section 4.2.3 \nclarified  \nConsideration of \noff-balance \nsheet exposures  EBA should instruct institutions to have internal procedures in place to assess \ntheir off -balance sheet exposures and, in particular capital market activities .  Procedures should be proportionate to ESG \nrisks associated with different activities.

The Guidelines do not require exit or de -\nfinancing; alignment assessments can be \nused as starting point to focus engagement \non certain counterparties.  Section 4.2.3 \nclarified  \nPara. 35a  \n1990 base year \nnot feasible  The reference to the 1990 baseline is not workable for banks  (e.g., did the \ncurrent group structure exist already in 1990). We also would like to flag that \nunder the EBA ST \"fit for 55\" exercise, banks were asked to work on a 2022 \nbaseline.  EBA should provide more flexibility. The priority for institutions \nshould be to develop a methodology of portfolio alignment in relation to the \nwider EU target, in order to identify the gap between this target and \ninstitutions’ own portfolios and manage the risk arising from any gaps.  The reference to 1990 should be understood \nin the context of the EU objective to reduce \nemissions at the jurisdiction’s level. It does \nnot apply to 1990 banks portfolios but to \ndecarbonisation pathways at EU level.  Section 4.2.3 \nclarified  \nPara. 35a - \nFinancial risks  It should be clarified that alignment gaps can be leading directly to financial \nrisks for the bank . Alignment assessments support climate \ntransition risks and  related financial risks \nassessments.  Section 4.2.3 \nclarified.  \nPara. 35a  \nSupport for S&G \nmatters  Including S&G could provide more holistic view of sustainability.  \nFor social and governance matters the portfolio based methodology can \npoint to social and governance related metrics of SFDR Principal Adverse \nIndicators as relevant portfolio level indices.  \nPlease provide more guidance  on how to apply the portfolio -based \nmethodology to social and governance risks . It is considered preferable to give institutions \nflexibility to develop their methodologies on \nS and G risks.  \n No change  \nPara. 35b - scope \nof paragraph  Clarify whether paragraph 35b only relates to transition risk  (i.e. in relation \nto 35a) and excludes physical risk.

The EBA should encourage European banks to voluntarily uptake \nMortgage Portfolio Standard (given that mortgage portfolios are a \nmaterial source of climate risk) as part of their strategies to decar-\nbonise their assets and to manage and act upon their ESG ri sks, and \nrely on the NZBA portfolio -level tools. European banks would then \ndevelop emissions metrics using on PCAF to quantify financed emis-\nsions, and finally set targets through SBTi.  \n6. Instead of using the IEA scenario as a baseline, use the Paris Agree-\nment scenario.

Section 4.2.3 \namended  \nPara. 36  \nExplain use of \ncounterparty -\nlevel data  Require institutions to highlight how they use counterparty -level data to \nperform portfolio analysis.

Para. 38a should mention also \"impacts\" on nature and not only \"de-\npendencies\" to better represent the environmental risks stemming \nfrom the portfolio exposures . The Guidelines do not require specific tools \nbut institutions can consider the tools \nmentioned in the comments as well as \npotential other tools and data bases.  \nImpacts on nature has been added with a \nview to assessing potential related financial \nrisks.  Section 4.2.3 \namended  \nPara. 38  \nRequirement \ngoes beyond \nmandate; impact \nmateriality  Para. 38 is impact materiality. But either (i) the institution has made \ncommitments and full transparency must be provided on the method and \nscope of these commitments, or (ii)  it has not made a commitment and the \nguidelines must not create a framework and an obligation to make a \ncommitment.  Adverse impacts may result in financial \neffects.  \n No change  \nPara. 38b  \nRemove SDG or \nconcerns related  1. Support.  \n2. Remove reference to SDG goals; positive impact goes beyond risk \nperspective. The EU and member states utilize the SDGs as a frame-\nwork for setting political goals in legislation. Therefore, alignment \nanalyses implicitly cover the SDGs.  \n3. The CSRD sufficiently addresses how companies position themselves \nin relation to the SDGs.  \n4. The requirement is deemed restrictive and not consistent across the \ndocument.  \n5. Caution that in some business activities, conflicts between the SDG \ngoals arise.  \n6. Why would EBA refer to SDGs when we have principal adverse im-\npacts within SFDR?  Couldn't the Regulatory Technical Standards be \nused for this?  The requirement has been maintained as it \nonly applies to large institutions and can \ninform the assessment of risks linked to a \nrange of ESG factors, taking into account data \nrequested or made available under other \nregulations such as CSRD and SFDR.  \n No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n106 \n \nGL on scenario \nanalysis  In relation to the future Guidelines on scenario analysis, it would be helpful \nfor the EBA to provide additional detail on the anticipated timelines and \nscope.  The EBA will issue a consultation in Q1 2 025 \nand final Guidelines by end -2025.  No change  \n \nQuestion 10 : ESG risk management principles  \n \n(par. 40) ESG as \ndriver of \ntraditional risk \ncategories  We welcome the recognition that ESG risks are not an independent risk type, \nbut transversal in the sense that they influence traditional risk types.  \nDepending on the paragraph ESG seems to be a separate risk instead of a \ndriver of traditional risks.  The definition of ESG risks provided in CRR \napplies throughout the  Guidelines.   No change  \n(par. 42 intro) \ntime horizons of \n10 years - too \nshort  We encourage the EBA to consider a longer time horizon  than 10 years \nbecause: need  to capture the longer -term physical effects of climate change ; \nthe (NGFS) scenarios tend to be longer term ; transition plans are aiming for \nnet zero emissions by 2050 ; many net -zero commitment and climate pledges \naiming for 2050.   See above on time horizons and below on \nplans.  \n \n Section 5.1 \nclarified  \n(par. 42 intro) \ntime horizon of \n10 years - too \nlong  \n \n The 10 -year time horizon implies enormous challenges given the lack of \navailable data, as well as the uncertainties inherent to the transition. \nInstitutions should therefore be granted enough flexibility to set their own \ntime horizons and interim milestone s under the Guidelines.  \n \nA time horizon of 10 years or longer is feasible and adequate for many \ninstitutions. However, promotional banks and guarantee institutions \nmembers pursue business models and funding mandates that are \ncharacterised by shorter terms and observation periods. Th is also applies to \nthe period typically considered in the risk management process for material \nrisks. We therefore propose that the wording here be adapted to a long time \nhorizon so that a suitable definition can be made for the institutions on the \nbasis  of the business model and the respective funding mandate.  The section has clarified that banks should \ntake into account the principles applied to \nthe level of granularity and quantification \ntools outlined in paragraph 19.  \n \nChallenges for long time horizons exist but \nvarious including long time horizons need to \nbe integrated into comprehensive and \nforward -looking risk management \napproaches for ESG risks, as also required by \nCRD, which also specified the minimum 10 \nyears perio d. Section 5.1 \nclarified  \n(par. 42 intro) \nsupport  The principles seem consistent to us and the \"minimum\" range of tools for \nmanaging and monitoring ESG risks seems sufficient to us.

Banks may decide to \napply some tools to a higher/lesser extent, \nensuring consistency with their risk appetite.   \n(par. 42 intro) \nlanguage  In par  42d, the term “ESG-relevant criteria ” is not precise enough. It should \nbe replaced by the term “ESG risk -relevant criteria ”. The term has been changed to ESG -risk \nrelevant criteria.   Section 5.1. \namended  \n(par. 42 intro) \nProportionality  The engagement policy should not be a binding tool in its scope \n(counterparty and services concerned) and in the elements to be included \ntherein as it relates to the customer and trust relationship between the \ncustomer and the bank. We therefore recommend t hat the guidelines \npresent this topic as a tool that the institution can consider in a proportionate \nmanner . The banks should consider engaging \ncounterparties for sound risk management \nand transition planning. See also clarification \non the scope below.  Section 5.1 \namended  \n(par. 42a) \nEngagement \nactivities – \nsuggestion to \ncreate dedicated \nEBA GL on this \npoint, more \nguidance needed  Need of EBA guidelines on institutions’ engagement with counterparties: for \nthe paragraph 42 a), we strongly recommend EBA to develop such guidelines, \nas a follow up of these guidelines (ie in the course of 2025). Indeed, the points \n(a) to (d) are not deta iled enough and will very likely be difficult to implement \nand to monitor. For example, it is not specified at all what the “soundness” \nof counterparties’ transition plans should mean (ii) and how they should be \nassessed by institutions. For this critical issue of transition plan assessment, \nEBA should build on the ATP -COL global multi -stakeholder initiative, led by \nthe World Benchmarking Alliance. What engagement means exactly should \nbe specified by EBA.  The EBA is not mandated to issue other, new \nGuidelines on engagement. However, \nrequirements for engagement policies as well \nas for the assessment of counterparties’ ESG \nrisks have been included in these final \nGuidelines on ESG risk management.  No change  \n(par. 42a \nEngagement \nactivities as risk \nmitigation tool – \nneed to be \neffective and \ncredible  We support the recognition of the role that engagement should play as a tool \nto mitigate ESG risks. However, EBA should clarify the expected measures to \nencourage counterparties to mitigate and disclose ESG risks. Institutions \nindeed cannot consider having mitigated their ESG risks if engagement does \nnot result in mitigating actions at the level of the counterparty or in the \nintegration of the actual risk . Engagement activities should therefore be \nlinked to clear time -bound objectives, an escalation process  and a The final Guidelines have incorporated in this \nsection the requirements on engagement \nthat were originally part of section 6, and \nwhich include aspects relating to \ncounterparty -specific actions, including exit \nas a last resort. Escalation procedures should Section 5.1 \namended.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n108 \n \ndivestment strategy for off -track counterparties or counterparties with no \nsound and credible transition plans.  be specified in the engagement policies (see \nbelow).   \n(par. 42a) \nEngagement \nactivities – \ninfluence, \nfeasibility/ \nflexibility, \nproportionality, \npotential clashes  \n The lever with the counterparts highly depends on the type of services banks \nprovide and the depth of their customer relationship . \n \nWe fully share the EBA view on the importance of engagement policy to \nensure consistency with banks ’ climate commitments. However, we are \nwondering whether these guidelines are an appropriate place to stipulate \nengagement policies.  The first objective of the engagement policy is to \ncollect relevant data which is consistent with the need of data quality.  \nBeyond that, the need for banks to strive towards improving the \ncounterparts ’ ESG profile (and relative metrics) should be left as a tool that \nbanks may con sider managing their ESG risks or the implementation of their \ntransition plans, instead of being required in these guidelines.  \n \nWe would like to highlight that there does not appear to be any \nproportionality around the proposed requirement for institutions to engage \ncounterparties, as specified in para 42(a).  These elements would be considered by \nbanks in their engagement policies.  \n \nThe Guidelines refer to engagement as a \nmeans to gather relevant information in the \ndata processes section. In addition, \nengagement as a tool in the risk management \nand transition planning toolbox is considered \nrelevant also from a prudential perspective.  \n \n \n \n \nThe Guidelines have clarified that banks \nshould determine the scope of \ncounterparties with whom to engage.  Section 5.1 \namended  \n(par. 42a(i, ii)) \nWhich \ncounterparties \nto engage with – \nmore precision \nneeded  \n \n \n \n \n Need for specification: We call on EBA to provide more granular definitions \non the terms most important and most critical counterparties,  large \ncounterparties and large corporate counterparties.  \n \nWe note that the Draft Guidelines include various qualifiers to describe the \nscope of counterparties that should be covered by engagement activities.  A \nbalance needs to be struck between encouraging institutions to meaningfully \nengage with counterparties who are most relevant to the management and \nmitigation of ESG risks, and avoiding creating an overburdening obligation to \ndemonstrate engagement with ev ery possible counterparty.  A key learning \nin relation to striking this balance was that prioritisation of  stakeholders is \nvital. However, the group of relevant or priority  counterparties can vary \nwidely across financial institutions, depending e.g. on the business model of \nthe firm, the sectors it provides financing to, or the geographic location of The final Guidelines require banks to \ndetermine the scope of counterparties with \nwhom to engage, taking into account their \nmateriality assessment and risk \nmeasurement methodologies to support \ntheir prioritisation choices.  \n Section 5.1 \namended.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n109 \n \nthe counterparties. In addition, it may make sense for an institution to evolve \nits stakeholder prioritisation over time . Importantly, the size of a \ncounterparty  may not necessarily be a reliable proxy of whether engagement \nwith that counterparty should be prioritised, as size may not be a good \nindicator of the extent of that counterparties ’ relevance to the ESG -risk \nexposure of the financial institution and/or the success of its transition plan. \nIn some cases, the financial exposure to a given counterparty  may be more \nrelevant.   \n(par. 42a(i)) \nWhich \ncounterparties \nto engage with – \nmateriality \ncriteria and \ndefinition of \ncriticality  In the identification of priority counterparties where engagement should be \ncarried, we also recommend EBA clarifying the factors of criticality. The size \nof the exposures, but also the sector, the availability of transition plans, the \nlocation and the deviation from initial transition targets are factors that \nshould be considered.   \n \nWe would also emphasise that the scope of counterparty engagement \nshould be linked to institutions materiality assessment , rather than solely \nsize.  That is the prerequisite to ensure efficient allocation of resources . See answer provided above.  Section 5.1 \namended  \n(par. 42a(i)) \nWhich \ncounterparties \nto engage with – \ninclusion of \nSMEs needed  We also contend that engagement strategies should also include SMEs. Non -\nlarge corporates will play an important role in the transition to a low -carbon \neconomy, and institutions, through relationship managers, could contribute \nto this role. This would also  prevent the generation of a portfolio -level \nblindspot, where small ESG -related risks could, in the aggregate, become \nmaterial to institutions.  SMEs may be included in the scope of \ncounterparties to engage with, depending on \ninstitutions’ nature of activities.  See \nclarification on scope below.  Section 5.1 \namended  \n(par. 42a(ii)) Role \nof banks in \nassessing clients \ntransition plans  We support these ESG risk management principles, in particular paragraph \n42 on the need to consider a range of risk management and mitigation tools, \nincluding engagement with counterparties on their transition plans to \nimprove their ESG risk profile . No response needed .

Even with a limit  to \nlarge counterparties, assessing the credibility of transition plans could in \npractice be a huge challenge for banks, especially without clear benchmarks \nand further guidance as to the depth of the assessments and a clear link to \nmateriality of risks. In  any case such requirement would go beyond what \nshould be the responsibilities of banks.  The expectations sh ould therefore be \nclarified, including on the role of auditors  in the assessment of clients \ntransition plans. While banks should be in the position to understand client s \nplans, they should be able to rely on the auditors assessment of the \nrobustness, soundness and credibility of these plans.  We should be able to \npresume that plans published under CSRD are credible, reliable, robust, and \nsound.  Moreover, it should be noticed that if this process is to be made by \nevery bank, it can come with different outcome s. The Guidelines do not refer to credibility but \nto transition plan of counterparties as \npotential risk mitigation factors. Assurance \nprovided by auditors in the CSRD/ESRS \ncontext do not relieve banks’ responsibility \nfor assessing the risk profile of their c lients.  \n No change  \n(par. 42a(iii)) - \ngreenwashing \nrisk Need for specification: provide further guidance on how to assess processes, \nand define escalation mechanisms where greenwashing risk is not mitigated . \nWe have concerns about  the evaluation of the processes of borrowers to \nidentify and mitigate greenwashing risks. The requirement seems to go far in \nterms of banks’ interference in clients’ management. Banks should not be \nmade responsible for the review of the risk of greenwashing of their \ncounterparties (even the larger ones).  From a proportionality point of view, \nat least LSIs and SNCIs should be excluded from the analysis of greenwashing \nrisks.  Requirements on the management of \ngreenwashing risk have been removed from \nthis section and consolidated in section 5. 6. \n Section 5.1 and \nsection 5.6 \namended  \n(par. 42a(iv)) \nEngagement \nactivities – \nencourage to \nmitigate risks  Paragraph 42 a) iv. should also mention explicitly here the use of an \nescalation process as part of the engagement process, including the potential \nrecourse by the bank to coalitions with other financial actors where relevant. \nThis escalation process is key  for the bank to make the most of its \nengagement  with the counterparty in a context of risk management . See above on integration of requirements \noriginally part of section 6, and below on \nengagement policies including escalation \nprocedures to be specified under plans.  Section 5.1 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n111 \n \nIn addition, we recommend a new point (vi) on divestment when needed as \na last resort strategy, if the escalation process is deemed to fail. As a matter \nof fact, EBA mentions  “last resort cessation of the relationship when \ncontinuation is considered incompatible with the institution ’s planning and \nrisk appetite ”, in Pararaph 103.  \n(par. 42b) more \nguidance  The EBA could consider establishing more granular guidance on the \noperationalization of these management principles, such as methodologies \nfor adjusting financial terms based on ESG risk assessments.   The granularity of the Guidelines has been \nconsidered sufficient.  No change  \n(par. 42b) \nEngagement \nactivities - \nadjusting \nfinancial terms \nand/or pricing - \nchallenging  At present, institutions may face challenges in empirically detecting the \nimpact of ESG issues on the PD or calculating the ESG -sensitivity of the risk \npremium. This information is crucial for adjusting financial terms.  \nWhile adjusted pricing policy may result from the credit rating of the \ncounterparts it should not been seen as an automatic tool to use to manage \nESG risks. Indeed, such a tool, if required by regulation, could result in level \nplaying field issue where oth er banks will offer better prices.   \nThis could create important level playing field issues, resulting in EU banks \nbecoming less competitive than non -EU banks, which do not face such \nrequirements . It may also disincentivize institutions from providing transition \nfinance.  Also, in the case of syndicated loans where several banks are \ninvolved, it may be complex to unilaterally change financial terms and \nconditions . The EBA acknowledges that there  are \nchallenges but institutions should develop \ntheir practices to assess the impact of ESG \nrisks on financial risk types.  \nThe Guidelines require banks to consider \nadjustments in their pricing policies, whe re \nrelevant and in line with their risk appetite.  \n No change.  \n(par. 42c) Risk \nmanagement/mi\ntigation - Risk \nlimits  We also ask for clarification that a limit is not set or derived solely on the \nbasis of ESG aspects. Various risk drivers are responsible for this as part of \nrisk management. This one -sided presentation of the limit (purely on the \nbasis of ESG criteria) wo uld not be consistent and should not be understood \nas integration into the existing methods and procedures . \nTo avoid misunderstandings, we request the following rewording: \n“considering ESG for the purpose of setting global, regional and / or sectoral \nlimits, ... ”. The final Guidelines have been adjusted by \nclarifying that ESG risks should be considered \nwhen setting limits.  \n Section 5.1 \namended  \n(par. 42c and e) \nRisk mitigation \ntools – role of The EBA should acknowledge the role of sectoral policies and especially fossil \nfuel sectoral policies and other restrictions in ESG risk mitigation: Today, \nmany financial institutions already consider this, notably by adopting sectoral Sectoral policies have been added more \nclearly in the range of tools.

The example could be \nremoved as the bank establish es its own standards for diversification, \nconsidering various factors. Although ESG criteria are significant, they are of \nsecondary importance in this context.  \nWe do not agree with the request for banks to diversify their lending and \ninvestment portfolios based on ESG -relevant criteria. EBA should not request \nbanks to have a certain percentage of exposures towards green investments \nas a risk mitigation tool but must allow banks to as sign investments towards \nsustainable activities based on their overall commitments and investors ’ \nappetite. Banks should focus on the quality of their exposures, and not on \nthe volumes of green exposures.  Yes, ‘e.g. in terms of  economic sector or \ngeographical area’ is an example of possible \napplication. As in the rest of the section, the \nrequirement is to consider this tool as part of \na risk management approach.  \n \nDiversification can support institutions in \nmanaging ESG risks, without any \nrequirement set in the Guidelines on the \nvolumes of green exposures.  \n No change  \n \nQuestion 11: section 5.2 – ESG risks in strategies and business models  \n \nGeneral  The provisions should be reinforced, via among others divestment from most \nenvironmentally harmful sectors or development of clear strategies to \nfinance and push the transition.

Escalation has been mentioned more \nexplicitly in paragraph 80 in section 5. 7.  Section 5.7 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n114 \n \nConnection and \nneed for \nconsistency \nbetween risk \nappetite and \nstrategic \nbusiness model \nobjectives  Risk appetite is a framework for dialogue between strategy and risk \nconsiderations. It would be useful to take advantage of this framework to \nensure overall consistency with any climate commitments made by the bank, \nthe transition plan and its sector -speci fic dimensions on objectives \n(decarbonization, financing).  \nAll this should feed into the risk appetite and credit limits that the institution \nmust set itself, if we assume that the prudential transition plan must \ncontribute to (or not detract from) the climate transition plan.  The Guidelines have added that the \nintegration of ESG risks in the risk appetite \nshould be consistent with the institution’s \nstrategic objectives and commitments and \nwith the plans and targets specified under \nsection 6.   \n Section 5.3 \nclarified  \n(general) \nplanetary \nboundaries  Given the unprecedented urgency of the state of climate change and nature \nloss, we recommend EBA to express more prescriptive recommendations on \nwhat level of ESG risk appetite might be considered excessive or dangerous. \nIn this, we suggest referring to th e planetary boundaries.  The Guidelines specify risk management \narrangements from a microprudential \nperspective . \n No change  \n(general) insights \nfrom stress \ntesting  Additionally, the EBA could provide guidance on integrating ESG risks into \nstress testing frameworks, further informing risk appetite decisions with \nforward -looking insights.   Inputs from stress testing should inform \nbusiness strategies under 5.2 hence risk \nappetite.   No change  \n(general) ESG as \nstand - alone vs. \ndriver of \ntraditional risk \ncategories  It is not clear why ESG should play a separate role as a risk driver when \ndetermining risk appetite compared to traditional risks. Ultimately, it \nmaterializes in the known risk types for which risk limits and risk capital are \nset or allocated.  \nThe separate consideration of ESG as a risk driver when defining the bank’s \nrisk appetite is questionable, as it affects the traditional risks.  ESG risks need to be defined and addressed \nin risk appetite in order to manage their \nimpacts as they materialise in traditional risk \ntypes. This is in line with BCBS principles and \nCRD6 which refers to “risk appetite in terms \nof ESG risks ”.  No change  \n(par. 46) no \nappetite \n(exclusion)  Paragraph 46 outlines that the risk appetite should specify the type and \nextent of ESG risks institutions are willing to assume. This should be further \nnuanced indicating that this should include no appetite / exclusion areas, e.g \nknowingly lending to comp anies that will use the money to violate human \nrights.  The Guidelines require banks to determine \nKRIs such as limits, thresholds or exclusions.  \n No change  \n(par. 46, 47) \nproportionality, \nflexibility, too \nmuch granularity \nrequired in the To ensure proportionality, the granularity of the requirements should be \nadjusted. Institutions should be granted more flexibility in defining their ESG \nrisk appetite, taking into account factors such as business model, size, and \nportfolio structure. For e xample, it may be considered excessively granular \nfor large institutions with a diversified business model to provide a higher \nlevel of detail than at the country level. As with other sections of this The final Guidelines have clarified that \ninstitutions should determine their KRIs \nbased on their business model and have \nadded a reference to risk limits set at a lower \nlevel within institutions, so that ESG risks are \nboth captured at the highest level wit h Section 5.3 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n115 \n \ncurrent \nparagraph  consultation paper, we kindly request that this be limited to key assets, \nmaterial products, and services.  \nWe believe that the significance of identifying the type and degree of ESG \nrisks at the granularity of the proposed guidance is minimal.  \nIt is difficult to have too many metrics in the RAS, only the most appropriate \nones should be selected. In addition to being technically difficult to construct, \nsuch a level of granularity would make it difficult to understand and link with \ncapital allocat ion. selected key indicators and at lower levels \nwith potential additional indicators and \nlimits, consistent with the overall risk \nappetite.  \n \n(par. 47) further \nguidance on ESG \nKRIs  We suggest that further guidance should be provided with regard to the term \n\"ESG -related key risk indicators\", i.e. in particular with regard to the \ncatalogue of criteria, the framework and scope of this requirement.  ESG-related KRIs should translate the risk \nappetite into concrete indicators, in line with \nthe risk appetite function and design.   No change  \n(par. 47) \nminimum set of \nKRIs is too large  Institutions should be allowed to justify removing KRI from the minimum set \nof KRIs to be used for defining the ESG risk appetite, e.g. in case of lacking \ndata availability or alternative and comparable steering measure already in \nplace.  The final Guidelines have clarified that banks \nshould determine which KRIs they include in \nthe risk appetite, by considering metrics \nunder 5. 7. Section 5.3 \nclarified  \n(par. 47) \nlanguage  In paragraph 47, the term “ESG considerations ” gives rise to \nmisunderstandings and should be replaced by  “ESG risk considerations ”. The final Guidelines use the term ESG risks \nconsiderations.  Section 5.3 \nclarified  \n(par. 46, 47) \nneed to \ndistinguish \nbetween top -\nlevel RAF and \nlower -level limits \nframework  In the proposed guidelines we do not see a clear differentiation between the \nRisk Appetite Framework (RAF) and the general limit/threshold framework \nthat an entity can have at a lower management level. It is important to make \nthis differentiation, to avoid  hampering the correct functioning of the risk \nappetite framework. The RAF is a formally defined process, with a strict \ngovernance model. It is approved by the Board of Directors, and it is based \non internal metrics. The risks included in the risk appetite  framework must \nbe quantitatively targeted, measurable, and monitored within a specific \ntimeframe (monthly, quarterly). Moreover, they must be carefully selected \nas the most relevant within their risk category, as we are the top \nmanagement level. Any other  limit/threshold system should be left for lower \nmanagement levels.  The final Guidelines have clarified that \ninstitutions should determine their KRIs \nbased on their business model and have \nadded a reference to risk limits set at a lower \nlevel within institutions, so that ESG risks are \nboth captured at the highest level wit h \nselected key indicators and at lower levels \nwith potential additional indicators and \nlimits, consistent with the overall risk \nappetite.   Section 5.3 \namended  \n(par. 48) \ncascading not \nfeasible, and For large institutions, metrics and targets must be set at consolidated level \nand it would not be feasible to run different sets of metrics at group level and The final Guidelines have been adjusted to \nrequire that institutions should ensure that \nall relevant group entities and business lines Section 5.3 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n116 \n \ncould lead to \noutsized focus \non ESG inside \nRAF at more granular levels. This could create adverse effects and would certainly \nbe too difficult to monitor.  \nAlso it seems important to keep in mind that adding too many metrics, \ntargets and limits on ESG considerations may create dangerous unbalanced \neffects on the full edifice of the Risk appetite framework compared to other \nrisks. As such, we recommend startin g with basic ones and to incorporate \ngradually as ESG factors become material new ones.  \nIn any case, banks should give enough flexibility to choose relevant metrics \nwith targets and limits/ with a focus on the most material risks to its business \nmodel.  \nThe consideration of ESG risks in risk appetite should be aligned with the \nentities' management that already considers the embedding of such risks \nconsidering their geographical footprint, business diversification, among \nother factors. Banks should not be r equired to change their management \nprocesses due to the requirement to conduct a cascade down approach. Risk \nappetite should be monitored in those risks deemed material according to \nentities' own models and internal procedures (e. g., at client level, por tfolio \nlevel) . \nRather  than cascading, a combination of origination policies and close \nmonitoring could prove much more efficient and would avoid potential \nadverse effects.  and units bearing risk properly understand \nand implement the institution’s risk appetite. \nRisk limits set at different levels within \ninstitutions should be consistent with the \noverall risk appetite in terms of ESG risk.  \n \n \nQuestion 13: Section 5.4 – ESG risks in internal culture, capabilities and controls  \n \n(section 5.4 in \ngeneral) \nsupportive; tone \nfrom the top is \nkey  Strongly support the inclusion of the proposed guidance on culture, \ncapabilities and controls within the scope of the EBA Draft GL. These all play \na critical role in ensuring that companies are able to respond effectively to \nESG risks, including by developing and implementing robust and credible \ntransition plans.

No change  \n(section 5.4. in \ngeneral) too \nprescriptive / \nredundant, \nsuggestion to \ndelete the whole \nsection 5.4  The EBA GL on Internal Governance provide sufficient framework for the \nimplementation of an appropriate risk culture and the concept of the 3 LODs. \nThe explanations in section 5.4. are redundant with the mentioned GL and \ncontrary to considering ESG as driv er of existing risk categories.  \nBanks' internal governance and control guidelines already include specific \ninstructions that affect the whole entity and should suffice. Separate policies \nand governance for ESG purposes should not be required. Banks should be \ngranted the flexibility choosing the way they organize suiting their own \ncircumstances and preferences, taking into consideration ESG factors when \nappropriate and integrate ESG into their existing processes. Standalone \nprocesses and controls to manage ESG risk factors should not be required.  \nSection 5.4 is too restrictive of the organizational freedom of institutions with \nregard to ESG topics. We are in favour of deleting this section.   The explicit incorporation of ESG risks into \nthe overall risk culture and three lines of \ndefence model is deemed an important part \nof sound risk management of ESG risks.

No change  \n(par. 49) fit and \nproper - goes \ntoo far  Agree on importance of train ing management on ESG given the novelty of \nthese risks  but it should not be a determinant factor in considering a member \nof the management bodies as unsuitable.  \nSuitability assessments for managers and key function holders should not be \nused as a tool to choose decision -makers in institutions according to their \noverall ESG political preferences.

No change  \n(par. 49 and 50) \nlanguage on ESG   \n In pars. 49 -50 t he term \"ESG factors and risks\" is misunderstandable  and \nshould be replaced by \"ESG risk factors\". In paragraph 53 (d), the terms \"ESG \nfeatures\" and \"ESG aspects\" should be replaced by \"ESG risk features\" and \n\"ESG risk aspects\", respectively, for clarity. It should not be a goal to impose \nbank supervisors' ESG policies and societal norms when it comes to the \navailability and pricing of financial services for individuals or corporates.   Terminology has been adapted to refer to \nESG factors and ESG risks. However, with \nregard to products it is considered more \nappropriate to refer to ESG features or ESG \naspects.  \n Section 5.4 \namended  \n(par. 49 / 50) \nESG KPIs should \nfeed into \nperformance \nevaluation and \nremuneration  KPIs should be integrated into performance evaluation  and remuneration  \nframeworks.  \nRemuneration schemes must be consistent with the institution's prudential \nplan and formulated strategies, ensuring alignment with broader business \nobjectives and risk management priorities.  \nRemuneration schemes are key to ensure integration of ESG factors and risks \nin the bank's internal organization.

Section 5.4 \namended  \n(par. 53b) 2nd \nLOD – \nCompliance \nfunction  \nresponsibilities \nneed aligning \nwith various \nexisting EBA GLs \nand ECB Guide  Given that within standard corporate governance the compliance function \ndoes not usually bear the ultimate responsibility of the firm's adherence to \nlaws and regulations, we suggest aligning th is with paragraph 209 of EBA GL \non internal governance (EBA/GL/2021/05), with paragraph 47 of EBA G L on \nthe role of the AML/CFT Compliance Officer (EBA/GL/2022/05) and with \nExpectation 5.5 of ECB Guide on C&E risks (2020) and thereby adopt a \nformulation similar to the ones mentioned, such as: \"the compliance function \nshould advise the management body on measures to be taken to ensure \ncompliance with\" applicable rules and regulations.  The Guidelines have been further aligned \nwith the Guidelines on internal governance \nand include language as suggested in the \ncomment.  \n Section 5.4 \namended  \n(par. 53b)  \nDescription of 2 \nLOD compliance \nfunction, explicit \nmention of the \nlegal function \nand nuancing \nthe split of \nresponsibility \ninside \noperational risks  Propos al to add the underlined words : The compliance function should \noversee how the first line of defense ensures adherence  to applicable ESG \nrisks rules and regulations and should, in relation to the sustainability \ncommitments made by the institution and the respective policies set, provide \nadvice on reputational and conduct risks  associated with the implementation \nor failure to implement such commitments. The legal function should provide \nadvice on legal risks, including litigation risk associated with the \nimplementation or failure to implement sustainability commitments .  \nRationale: As per dedicated EBA GL, the compliance function is a level 2 \nfunction and their main role is to oversee/to monitor the relevant 1st LOD, \ne.g. commercial units, as they are the owners of the risks. With respect to \nthe advisory role of compliance function, wording should be precise to \ninclude only reputational and conduct risks, as part of compliance risks  and \nnot the whole range of operational risks, since different functions cover \ndifferent types of operational risks. Legal risk, including litig ation risk, is \ntraditionally covered by legal function and this should be reflected also in this \nEBA GL.  The Guidelines have been further aligned \nwith the Guidelines on internal governance \nand include wording as suggested in the \ncomment, however without referring to the \nlegal function which is not subject to \nparticular requirements under EBA \nGuidelines on int ernal governance nor BCBS \nprinciples on climate risk management. It is \nhowever expected that all relevant functions \ncontribute to the management of risks, \nincluding ESG risks, in line with sound \ngovernance arrangements.   Section 5.4 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n121 \n \n(par. 53b) 2nd \nLOD – \nCompliance \nfunction  – not \nsolely \nresponsible for \nensuring \nadherence to \nESG \ncommitments, \nand not at all \nresponsible for \nsome of them  Ensuring adherence or providing advice regarding ESG risk rules or \nsustainability commitments does not have to be a sole responsibility of the \ncompliance function. Assignment of the responsibilities can vary among \ninstitutions for different reasons.  \nThe compliance function is usually not the sole function responsible for \nadvising on measures to be taken to ensure compliance with the entirety of \nrules, regulations and regulatory requirements - with prudential regulations \nin particular typically falling outside of its perimeter.  We would like the EBA \nto provide further detail on the \"applicable ESG risks rules and regulations\" \nto clarify Compliance responsibilities.  \nThe role of Compliance as regards \"sustainability commitments made by the \ninstitution\" is not central. There are several sustainability/ESG related \ncommitments which do not come under Compliance's scope  nor require \nspecific actions by Compliance, although Compliance has a coordination role \nregarding reputation risk.  See answers provided above. The compliance \nfunction does not have to be the sole \nresponsible for the aspects mentioned.  \n \n Section 5.4 \namended  \n(par. 53b) 2nd \nLOD – \nCompliance \nfunction  – not \nresponsible for \nsome of the risk \ntypes listed here, \nnotably \noperational and \nlegal risk – role \nof Legal function \nneeds to be \nexplicit here  \n It should also be noted that as a matter of principle, each Function is \nresponsible for risks within its perimeter, including ESG risk factors. \nConsequently, operational risk comes under RISK's scope, the same way legal \nrisk is under the responsibility of Legal  as a second line of defence (LoD2). As \nformulated, the draft GL do not reflect these organizational principles.  \nWe suggest that EBA comment on the envisioned role of 1st LoD in this \ncontext.  \nMoreover,  the EBA should further specify the role of Compliance in providing \n\"advice on operational risks\", as some of the risks listed (\"legal, reputational \nand conduct\") might fall outside of the scope of Compliance responsibilities, \ndepending on individual instit utional setups.  \nIn relation to [the Compliance function providing advice on operational risks \n(\"legal, reputational and conduct risks\") associated with sustainability \ncommitments, we recommend aligning with the EBA G L on internal \ngovernance and allow for all relevant functions to provide advice in their \nrespective field of expertise.  All relevant functions should provide advice \nin their respective field of expertise. The \nGuidelines focus on the 3 LODs, specified \nunder BCBS principles and EBA Guidelines on \ninternal governance. The operational risk has \nbeen removed from the paragraph on the \ncompliance function.  \n Section 5.4 \namended.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n122 \n \nRole of  \ncompliance for \nproducts  Paragraph 53c accurately summarizes the role of Compliance as regards, for \ninstance, new products with ESG features.  No response needed.  No change  \nRole of other \nnon-financial \nrisks specialists \nsuch as Legal  Agree with the role assigned to either the compliance or the risk \nmanagement units as shapers of the business units decisions, during the \ndesign and approval process of new products with ESG features or for \nsignificant changes to existing products to embed ESG aspects; but we \nrecommend to also include the rest of the non -financial risk specialists in this \nrole, for example, the legal unit.  See above – legal function should be involved \nin its area of expertise but the Guidelines \nfocus on the risk management and \ncompliance function.  No change  \n(par. 54) 3rd LOD Challenging specific metrics and calculations to establish the pathways goes \nbeyond the I nternal Audit Function’s  usual remit. They are built by LoD1 and \nreviewed by LoD2, and IAF should not be mandated to build specific \ncapabilities for this. Once the data is built by LoD1 and LoD2, IAF must inspect \nto ensure that the data has been managed with integrity, and that the \ntransition plans include the different aspects demanded by the regulation, \nbut nothing further.  The Guidelines do not mention challenging \nspecific metrics and calculations but \nreviewing quality and effectiveness of the \nESG risks governance framework.   No change  \n \nQuestion 14: Section 5.5 - ESG risks in ICAAP and ILAAP  \n \n(par. 55) ESG as \nstandalone \ndrivers or not  The ICAAP is a global p rocess that goes hand in hand with other internal \nprocesses. While we agree relevant ESG risk drivers should be incorporated \ninto the process, these risk drivers should be indistinguishable from the rest \nof the risks, meaning that the ICAAP should take into account al l relevant risk \ndrivers in the same manner.   \nWe support the approach to avoid a separate ESG ICAAP but rather include \nthe ESG dimension within the existing ICAAP . This is consistent also with the \noverall approach that sees ESG risks affecting the traditional risk categories.  ESG risks  are defined in CRR; they materialise \nthrough the traditional categories of financial \nrisks. The Guidelines have clarified that \nmaterial ESG risks and their impacts on \nfinancial risk types should be captured in the \nICAAP.  Section 5.5 \nclarified  \nNon -inclusion \njustification  It is unclear what would be expected in the case where an institution sees \nthat ESG risks do not affect the ICAAP (e.g. would a qualitative description as \nto why that is not the case be required?) . Institutions should provide sufficient \ninformation to understand their analysis of \nthe capital implications  of ESG risks .  No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n123 \n \nEconomic and \nregulatory \nperspectives  To the best of our knowledge, the EBA has not used the terms  “economic ” \nand “regulatory ” perspectives in its previous supervisory publications. A clear \ndefinition of these two terms is therefore necessary . These terms have been removed from the \nfinal Guidelines.  \n Section 5.5 \namended  \n(par. 55) too \nearly for E, S and \nG The climate risk dimension is fully integrated in our bank’s ICAAP. However, \nthe EBA should take a sequential perspective and start incorporating \nenvironmental -related risk factors and not rush into including social and \ngovernance until we have enough data to ensure we do it in a sound manner.  \n \nThe BCBS Climate Principles, which are more narrowly scoped in terms of risk \nfocus than the draft GL, recognize that \"climate -related financial risks will \nprobably be incorporated into banks' internal capital and liquidity adequacy \nassessments iteratively a nd progressively, as the methodologies and data \nused to analyse these risks continue to mature over time and analytical gaps \nare addressed.\"  This consideration should also be applied by the EBA in terms \nof recognizing that the ability of banks to capture climate -related risk drivers \nin the ICAAP exceeds that of broader E/S/G risk drivers . It is recognised that banks’ practices are \nmore advanced on climate -related risks. \nHowever, as explained in the Guidelines , \ntools and practices should be developed for \nother types of E risks and approaches to S and \nG should be gradually enhanced. CRD 6 in \narticle 73 (ICAAP) refers to ESG risks.  The \nsection notes that banks should take into \naccount the levels of availability and maturity \nof quantification methodologies for different \nrisks .  No change  \n(par. 55) \nConcerns on \nILAAP  The banking industry is at an early stage in terms of understanding the \ntransmission channels to liquidity risks . The lack of information is a significant \nobstacle to integrate ESG risks into the ILAAP , especially S and G.  \nThese draft recommendations are difficult to understand given the \nEBA/REP/2023/34 report on the role of E and S risks in the prudential \nframework, as no changes are expected regarding LCR and NSFR.  \nLiquidity risk is a short -term risk, whereas climate and environmental risks \nare more expected to materialize over a longer -term horizon. The \ndisconnection between these two timeframes means that the \nmaterialization of climate risks in the definition and management of liquidity \nbuffers today for banks is not expected to be material.  Nevertheless, to the \nextent that climate and environmental risk drivers could have consequences \non liquidity , these consequences would have to be taken into account . Given the characteristics of ESG risks as \ndrivers of liquidity risk , the evolving market \npractices and the regulatory framework, the \nfinal Guidelines have separated the \nrequirements on ICAAP and on ILAAP to focus \nthe latter on E and on appropriate time \nhorizons within the scope of ILAAP coverage.  \n Section 5.5 \namended  \n(par. 55) Long \ntime horizon vs. Certain methodological features related to ESG risks conflict with \nICAAP/ILAAP internal features and need to be further elaborated on before \nbeing requested. The forward -looking nature of ESG risks requires the use of Institutions should consider various time \nhorizons for the assessment of ESG risks. In \naddition, CRD article 73 requires banks to Section 5.5 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n124 \n \nICAAP purposes \n(usually 3 years)  long -term science -based scenarios  that cannot serve as a basis for financial \nprojections, because science -based ESG scenarios do not easily translate into \nfinancial risks scenarios. This requires a complete overhaul of current market \npractices in terms of scenarios and forecasts. Requesting an immediate \ninclusion of all ESG factors from longer term non -financial scenarios in \nfinancial forecasts of the ICAAP comes at the risk of basing analysis on \nforward -looking elements, whose impact on financial risks has  not yet been \nevidenced.  \nWe assume that the risk observation horizon in the ICAAP remains \nunchanged in both the normative and economic perspectives. Additionally, \nwe assume that no multi -year risk -bearing capacity calculation is required \nbeyond the normative perspective period. The most frequent time horizon \nin the ICAAP is 3 years. A multi -year calculation going beyond this should not \nbe mandatory . The longer -term time horizon of 10 years would serve to \ninform the normative and economic perspective with regard to possible ESG \nrisk factors.  Disagree with backing medium and long -term risks , which are \nnot reliably quantifiable, with internal capital  - this would be neither \nappropriate nor sensible.  \nThe time horizons considered for internal capital are fundamentally different \nfrom the time horizons considered for ESG purposes . For ICAAP, institutions \nmake forecasts based on methodologies, historical data and plausible \nscenarios that cannot easily translate into longer term horizons. These \nforecasts influence business planning and practical decision -making, which \ncan hardly be the case of 25 -year projections. Hence, time horizons that go \nbeyond 10 years should only be informative and not serve as a base  to the \nnormative and internal allocation of capital.  Capital should remain within the \ncurrent prudential practises, and not cover hypothetical medium to long \nterm ESG factors that will evolve in time, not necessarily translate into \nfinancial risks and be mitigated in time.  take into account the short, medium and long \nterms for the coverage of ESG risks. The EBA \nrecognises however that quantifying long -\nterm potential risks and building capital \nplanning for long time horizons raises \nchallenges. The Guidelines clarify that when  \ninstitutions take into account the short term, \nmedium term and long term for the coverage \nof ESG risks, longer time horizons should be \nused as a source of information to ensure \nsufficient understanding of potential \nimplications of ESG risks for capital pl anning. \nThe time horizons considered for the \ndetermination of adequate internal capital to \ncover ESG risks should be consistent with \ntime horizons used as part of the institutions’ \noverall and regular ICAAP.  \n \n(par. 56) Limits  It seems difficult to have specific limits/triggers regarding ESG impacts on an \nindicator like the CET1 ratio or the ICAAP.  Institutions should describe limits set for \nmaterial ESG risks.   No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n125 \n \n(par. 57) gradual \napplication?  Integration of ESG risks (to be checked on correct understanding) in ICAAP \nand ILAAP should only come after making progress on common \nunderstanding and reliability of data as a first step for a dedicated treatment \nof related exposures. A gradual and methodological approach i s preferable \nover setting (fixed) parameters and metrics.  It has been clarified that banks should use \ninsights gained from risk assessment \nmethods to support  the (binding)  integration \nof material ESG risks  in ICAAP .  Section 5.5 \nclarified  \n(par. 57) ref. to \nSection 4.2  We request clarification with regard to the reference in paragraph 57 to \nsection 4.2 that the reference is not intended to apply the longer -term \nalignment method in the ICAAP.  Insights gained through risk assessment \nmethods should be considered. See also \nabove on long -term time horizons.  No change  \n(par. 57) \nmethodologies \nand data  Are institutions free in terms of methodologies to use for the evaluation of \ninternal capital relative to their ESG risks/factors?  \nHistorical data is insufficient and there is no globally unified measurement \nmethod, so it is difficult to take into account ESG risks .

No change  \n(par. 57) pool of \nexposures  Other approach es may exist such as to identify and measure internal capital \nneed for pool of exposures homogenous in terms of ESG risks rather than \nindividual exposures.

No change  \n(par. 55 – 57) \ntoo prescriptive \nand too broad vs \ncurrent bank \napproaches & \nECB expectations  In line with the ECB Guide to ICAAP, the ICAAP is an internal process, and it \nremains the responsibility of individual institutions to implement it in a \nproportionate and credible manner. For now  only risks arising from ESG \nconsideration for part of the banking book are taken into consideration by \nbanks in the ICAAP, if they are material. The assessment is based on climate \nscenarios. Internal methodologies will be capturing counterparties transition \nplans as they become available.  We recommend aligning this  section with \nECB expectations on this part and what was done on materiality assessment \nby banks.  EBA Guidelines specify new CRD6 \nrequirements and will be subject to comply \nor explain processes for all EU competent \nauthorities.  \n No change  \n(par. 57) ref. to \nSection 4.2 on \nscenario -based \nmethodologies  Supervisory scenario setting does not align with the internal character of \nICAAP, and we propose to refrain from it . The required mandatory inclusion \nof E risk elements seems to have a permanent character, which does not \ncorrespond to the internal character of ICAAP stress tests under the \nnormative perspective, which should address a financial institution ’s key \nvulnerabilities also taking into account the scenario horizon of (at least) 3 \nyears.  The Guidelines do not set a particular \nscenario, but a forward -looking view of \ncapital adequacy considering potential future \nE risks is needed for sound risk management.   No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n126 \n \n(par. 57) capital \nneeds - Space for \ncapital relief \nneeded  Agree with integration of ESG risks and transition plans in ICAAP and ILAAP. \nHowever it seems that such integration will only require capital add -ons but \nnot capital relief. In the particular case of environmental risks, transition to a \nnet zero economy sho uld be capital neutral. It is true that there will be \nwinners (banks that orderly transition to net zero) and losers (banks that \ndelay transition relative to peers). We believe credible transition plans \nshould drive Pillar 2 capital relief while lagging p lans should attract capital \nadd-ons. Supervision including Pillar 2 capital \nrequirements is out of scope of these \nGuidelines. Banks should assess ESG risks \nimplications for their solvency.  \n No change  \n(par. 58) \nsupportive of \nscenario analysis \nfor climate but \nnot for (other) \nenvironmental \nrisks  We have planned to integrate considerations related to climate risks into the \nscenarios used for provisioning and capital planning. We have also  \nimplemented climate -related stress scenarios for specific risk analysis ( e.g. \nstress on cost -of-risk). But we do not plan to have capital planning scenarios \ndriven primarily by environmental risks. We consider it excessive to impose \nsuch specific stress scenarios for capital planning in the ICAAP.  Climate risks are part of E risks . The adverse \nscenario should include E risks elements but \nnot necessarily be primarily driven by E risks.  \n No change  \n(par. 58) more \ngranular \nguidance  Request for  more granular guidance on mode lling and quantifying the \nimpacts of ESG risks within ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks, including examples \nof adverse scenarios and stress testing methodologies  also to \ninterpret/understand reverse stress testing regarding ESG .  The Guidelines do not specify stress testing \nrequirements as this is, and will further be, \ncovered by dedicated  EBA Guidelines.  No change  \n(par. 58) too \nearly for full \nincorporation of \nE scenarios  Recognize the relevance of scenario analysis as a forward -looking tool to \nassess the possible impacts of climate -related risk drivers in the future, given \nthe long -term nature of climate change. But it  is premature for banks to fully \nintegrate E ris k related scenarios alongside the wider economic scenarios \nused for capital planning and projections, due to data and conceptual \nlimitations.  Climate risks are part of E risks, see also \nabove on C, E, S and G . \n No change  \n \nQuestion 15: S ection 5.6 – ESG risks in credit risk policies and procedures  \n \nChallenges for \nsocial risks  There are insufficient definitions concerning the social sphere to allow for an \nassessment of the adverse impact of such risks on an entity’s credit profile. \nIt is deemed challenging to determine materiality associated with social risks See above on C, E, S, G. Quantitative credit \nrisk metrics are required for E risks only in the \nGuidelines.  No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n127 \n \nand establish appropriate quantitative criteria and methods for evaluating \nthe impact on credit risk.  \nCredit risk – \nquantitative \nmethods  Quantitative credit risk metrics regarding environmental risks  have not yet \nbeen established and it is unclear what is specifically intended.  Further \nguidance should be provided regarding the requirement to develop and \nimplement quantitative credit risk metrics, such as a catalogue of criteria as \nwell as a description of the framework and scope of this requirement.  The Guidelines require to include \nquantitative metrics in credit risk \npolicies /procedures to support the \nmanagement of E risks. Institutions should \nset their metrics and can consider the metrics \nprovided in 5. 7.  No change  \nCredit risk – \n(permanent) use \nof qualitative \nmeasures  In addition to quantitative credit risk metrics, the use of qualitative methods \nshould be explicitly considered. The credit ratings established today consider \nboth, quantitative and qualitative aspects, including ESG risks. Some \ninstitutions may initially have to use qualitative methods if quantitative \nmethods are not yet appropriate. Further, for certain areas and f or certain \ninstitutions, the use of qualitative methods should be permanently available.  It has been clarified that institutions should \nimplement a combination of qualitative and \nquantitative approaches.  \n Section 5.6.1 \nclarified  \nInsufficiency, \nincompleteness \nand \nincomparability \nof ESG data  Especially in context of the application of quantitative credit risk metrics, the \ninsufficiency, incompleteness, and incomparability of ESG data has to be \nconsidered.  \nESG factors can drive credit policies in terms of portfolio segmentation, credit \nallocation, target selection. The analysis of ESG risks could improve the ability \nto perform an efficient and effective creditworthiness assessment with a \nmaterial impact on a t least the probability of default and the loss given \ndefault, if (and when) the underlined data is of appropriate quality. The most \nimportant barrier that can slower this process is represented by metrics and \ndataset. A lack of data is especially relevant  for smaller institutions.  See above on data.  Section 4.2 \namended  \nESG risk \nmitigation \nmeasures  The section on credit risk policies and procedures could be more specific on \nthe question of ESG risk mitigation measures. In particular an analysis of \ncompanies' transition plans in high -stake sectors would seem to be a priority.  See above on the exposure -based method \nand risk mitigating factors including \ntransition plan.  Section 4 \namended  \nIntegration of \nESG risks in loan \norigination and \nmonitoring \nprocesses  Credit granting policies should be aligned to the alignment trajectories that \nsome banks have publicly committed to follow.  \nAs part of credit policies, banks should clarify their procedures on \ncounterparty and projects that persistently  refuse or fail to implement a \ncredible transition plan.  Credit policy on large corporate counterparties Banks should ensure consistency between \ntheir strategy, risk appetite and risk \nmanagement policies  (see section 6) . \n Sections 5.1 and \nsection 6 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n128 \n \nshould include a conditionality of credit to the counterpart ies’ credible plan. \nSuch a policy should  also include an escalation process . Engagement with counterparties is covered \nunder sections 5.1 and 6.4.  \nCredit risk \nmetrics  Banks should monitor physical and transition risks in segments of portfolios \nthat are deemed to be material according to banks materiality assessment \nmethodology.   \nAs opposed to regulatory requirements for pricing strategies and pricing \ndecisions, a set of pricing best practices should be included. ESG -linked \nfeatures in lending are not intended to compensate institutions for taking on \nESG risks. Rather, the ESG adju sted interest rates and fees serve as an \n‘incentive’ for the borrowers to meet specified ESG targets and, by this, \nmitigate their transition risks.  A reference to the materiality assessment \nhas been included.   \n \nAs already laid out in the EBA GL on loan \norigination, the pricing structure of a loan \nproduct sh ould r eflect the inherent risk \nprofile of its counterparty, considering all \naspects including also ESG  factors. Best \npracti ces cannot be included.   Section 5.6.1 \namended.  \n \nNo change  \nProposed \nmethodologies  The EBA should encourage financial institutions to voluntarily adopt \nMortgage Portfolio Standards (‘MPS’).  \nFor the purpose of valuing collateral the IVSC International Valuation \nStandards could be referred to as they are applied globally.   Guidelines set requirements for banks.  \n \nSpecific details on the valuation of collateral \nare out of scope.  No change  \n \nQuestion 16: S ection 5.7 – ESG risks in policies and procedures for other  risk types  \n \nGeneral \ncomments  Article 4.1 point 52d of the CRR provides that environmental, social and \ngovernance risk materialise indirectly through the traditional categories of \nfinancial risks. Therefore, when it comes to para 63 and 66 of the draft ESG \nGuidelines, the EBA should st ick to the CRR 3 and not go beyond its mandate.  The Guidelines specify how ESG risks as \ndefined by the CRR should be taken into \naccount in policies for  management of  \ndifferent risk types.   No change  \nMarket risk  In relation to market risk, it is difficult to identify ex ante which part is due to \nESG as it is already embedded in the price of the products.  \nFurther  a waiver should be allowed for some of the charges suggested by the \nreport, such as adding a RRAO charge in FRTB -SA or asking for an RNIME in \nFRTB -IMA for explicitly ESG -linked derivatives, should the bank demonstrate \nto the satisfaction of competent auth orities that the possible losses \nassociated to them are already covered in the prudential framework.   \nStress test metrics are considered to be most suited indicators to account for \nderivatives.  Challenges are understood but banks should \ndevelop their approaches and \nunderstanding.  \nPillar 1 requirements are out of scope of \nthese Guidelines.  \nForward -looking analyses are key and \nmentioned in paragraph 67. \n No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n129 \n \nOperational risk  It is required to indicate whether the ESG factor flagging is required for each \noperational loss event. Further, it needs to be clarified whether the mapping \nshould follow the 7 operational risk categories according to Basel \nmethodology or operational risk  factors (people, processes, systems, \nexternal events).  \nParagraph 63 could provide illustrative examples of potential future impacts \nfrom ESG -risks that could have an impact on operational risk as well as other \nnon-financial risks such as litigation and reputational risks.  The E flag is required when it is a driver of the \nloss event.  Reference to Article 324 of CRR \nhas been included  regarding the different \nregulatory operational risk event types . \n \nESG risks can impact operational risks \nthrough various channels such as physical risk \ndrivers or litigation risk.  Section 5.6.4 \namended  \nOperational risk \nlosses – \nidentification \nand labelling  While the internal taxonomies already have a natural disaster label it is \nextremely difficult to differentiate between natural disasters that are directly \ncaused by environmental factors and those which are not (and driven by \ncyclical factors). Further gui dance is needed on how to identify and label \noperational losses related to the environmental risks given the indirect \nnature of ESG drivers.  The identification and labelling should be \ndone consistently with the risk taxonomy and \nmethodology to classify loss events  specified \nby the dedicated RTS on this issue. Reference \nto RTS pursuant to Article 317(9) of CRR \nadded.   Section 5.6.4 \namended  \nOperational risk \n– \nReputational risk  Specifically in relation to the references to reputational risk in paragraphs 53 \nand 63 of the draft Guidelines, the current drafting seems to include \nreputational risk as a component of operational risk, however that is \nmisaligned with the EU CRR3 definition of operational risk (which excludes \nreputational risk). We would suggest deleting these reference s to \nreputational risk in the final Guidelines for avoidance of confu sion. To clarify this issue the reputational risk is \ncovered under a separate paragraph in the \nfinal Guidelines.  \n Section 5.6 \namended.  \nReputational risk \nrelated to \ntransition plan  An explicit reference should be made, that a core aspect of reputational / \nlitigation risk is the discrepancy between bank s transition plan and actions.   \nTo address the reputational risk associated with banks failing to comply with \ntheir sustainability commitments or transitions plans, it is recommended that \nthe EBA specifies that these plans are dependent on the EU’s and Member \nStates’ commitments to achie ve climate neutrality, as outlined in the EU \nClimate Law. Further, reputational risks are not considered significant for LSIs \nin particular. Banks should not be held solely responsible in the event that \nthe EU or member states fail to meet or change their targets.  Discrepancy between plans and actions can \nlead to reputational and greenwashing risks \nas covered in the Guidelines.  \nThe EBA notes that external dependencies \nand assumptions should be explained by \ninstitutions when disclosing plans and \ntargets.  \n No change  \nPara 67  Para 67 should move away from provisions for yearly risk provisioning and \nfocus more on a dedicated RWA approach. Additionally, given that historical \nlitigation experiences are not fully public due to the confidentiality of some Changes to RWAs are out of scope of these \nGuidelines. The relevance of forward -looking Section 5.6.4 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n130 \n \nagreements, it is crucial to specify that any model incorporating historical \ndata might inherently underestimate this specific ESG risk. Therefore, a \ndedicated RWA for each transaction above a very substantial amount \n(limited to a few transactions) could b e more than sufficient to manage this \nliability risk effectively.  \nRegarding conduct, reputation, and litigation risk in para 67, we encourage \nmore focus on human rights, discrimination and other social controversies \nwhich are known and tracked for corporate counterparties.  analyses is however mentioned in paragraph \n67. \n \n \n \n \nViolations of human and social rights have \nbeen added to illustrate potential ESG -\nrelated controversies.  \nGreenwashing  Para 67 refers to the ESAs high -level understanding of greenwashing \n(EBA/REP/2023/16). This is not a legal definition and should hence not be \nreferenced in the EBA GL. The broad understanding of greenwashing reduces \nthe legal certainty and therefore risks hampering financial institutions \ntransition finance efforts.  \nClarification is needed if it is necessary to have a separate specific process to \nidentify, prevent and manage litigation or reputation risks resulting from \ngreenwashing or perceived greenwashing practices, or can it be catered for \nby regular internal proc esses and standard risk assessments.  \nParagraph 67 should be amended to consider situations where reputational \nrisk can also arise through NOT lending to or NOT investing in businesses, \nbecause ESG -related controversies can and will go both ways, as experience \nshows.  \nClarification on whether banks should expect the final guidelines to be \namended in accordance with the final report on Greenwashing, including \nconcrete examples of greenwashing across investment value chain the \nfinancial institutions should build on.   Reference has been kept as it provides a \nreference  point to understand greenwashing  \nin the financial sector . Clear, fair and non -\nmisleading transition finance efforts should \nnot be penalised.  \nESG risks including risks stemming from \ngreenwashing should be captured by regular \nrisk management processes.  \n \nInstitutions should consider various risk \nchannels but this specific addition is not \nconsidered necessary.  \n \nReference to the final report has been \nincluded. Institutions can consult the report \nincluding for examples.  Section 5.6.4 \namended.  \nConcentration \nrisk  The requirements included in the draft Guidelines on concentration risks \ncould have adverse impacts on the financing of the transition as they would \nnot consider counterparties transition strategies and pathways .  \n A reference to risk mitigating factors, which \ncan include counterparties ’ transition \nstrategies, has been included.  \n \nBanks remain responsible to set their risk \nappetite for ESG -related concentration risks.  Section 5.6.5 \nslightly \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n131 \n \nThe approach to concentration risk should remain flexible to allow banks to \nuse their own methodologies  and define and measure ESG concentration risk \naccording to their own methodologies, risk appetite and business models.  \n \nIt is very difficult to carefully define concentration risk in the context of ESG \nrisk factors; there is not currently a well -established definition in the EU or \nglobally. Thresholds for what constitutes a  high degree of concentratio n \nwould likely be needed, including analysis of an appropriate way to define \nand calibrate such thresholds. Given that the risk assessment process is \nmultidimensional, it is also necessary to avoid unintended consequences \nassociated with reliance on certain characteristics (e.g.  some of the proposed \nmetrics in the draft GL, such as GHG emissions) which could indicate that \ncertain sectors or geographies are more or less risky in a way that is too \ncrude.  \n \nSupervisors should not demand institutions attributing concentration risk \nwhere a sector may  or might  be prone to ESG risk factors. This is too \nsubjective and could be influenced by political opinion, thereby masking the \nreal risk drivers that would require the institutions’  attention. Sentence 2 of \nthis paragraph the words ‘may be’ should be replaced by ‘demonstrably are’  \n(data -driven approach). Sentence 3 should be deleted, because it is not \nhelpful for describing the process of how existing concentration  risk (as \nopposed to assumedly problematic sectors) can be determined.  \n \nAn approach of looking purely at industry concentration goes against banks’  \nefforts to engage with clients to assess the consistency of the clients' \ntransition plans with the i nstitution s transition planning. In addition, this \ncontradicts paragraph of the section 6.5 of the Guidelines. Besides, \nconcentration risk is already part of banks' risk management frameworks, \nincluding sector and geographical concentration, and it is also addressed  in \nthe Pillar 2 framework.    \n \nThe Guidelines require to manage ESG -\nrelated concentration risk understood as \nrisks posed by concentrations of exposures or \ncollaterals in single counterparties, \ninterdependent counterparties or in some \nindustries, economic sectors, or geographic \nregions which may present a higher degree of \nvulnerability to ESG risks ; however, for the \npurpose of the guidelines, thresholds for \nwhat constitutes high concentration risk \nshould be determined by institutions in \naccordance with their risk appetite.  \n \nAssessing concentration risk on a sectoral \nbasis does not force institutions to adopt any \nparticular risk mitigating action. Institutions \nshould decide how to best manage ESG -\nrelated concentration risks considering \nsection 5.1, which refers to engagement w ith \ncounterparties as one possible tool.  \n \n \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n132 \n \nQuestion 17: Section 5.8 – monitoring of ESG risks  \n \nGeneral  ESG factors are already incorporated in other existing and publicly available \nreports, so there should not be any additional requirement to produce a \nstandalone report.  Paragraph 78  provides  that banks may \nintegrate ESG risks into regular risk reports or \ndevelop new dashboards.  No change  \nGeneral  Indicators should not be considered mandatory in the final guidelines, but \nsufficient flexibility should be given to banks in the identification of the most \nappropriate metrics.  The EBA is mandated to specify standards, \ncriteria and methods for the monitoring of \nESG risks.  However, the full list of indicators \nis only mandatory for large banks while \nothers should monitor a range, that they will \nselect.  Section 5.7 \namended  \nGeneral  The focus is only on climate and considerations on other \"E\" risks and/or \"S\" \nand \"G\" should be included.  It is recognised that progress on metrics is \nmost advanced on climate. However, the \nsection  clarifies that large institutions should \nmonitor metrics related to nature and \nbiodiversity -related risks .  Section 5.7 \namended  \nGeneral  The EBA should clarify that ESG risk monitoring also fully covers off balance \nsheet activities and that facilitated emissions should be monitored.  It has been clarified that banks should have \nan institution wide view of ESG risks, \nadequately covering the nature, size and \ncomplexity of their activities.  Section 5.7 \nclarified  \nGeneral  The EBA should consider encouraging the development of industry -wide \nbenchmarks or thresholds for ESG risk indicators, facilitating peer \ncomparisons and transparency.  The EBA considers that thresholds should be \nset by banks. Benchmarks can usefully be \ndeveloped by the industry. The EBA is also \ndeveloping a risk monitoring framework.   No change  \nGeneral  The EBA should clarify the expected frequency of monitoring activity.  \nGiven that some risks, could materialise over varying or yet unknown time \nhorizons and especially climate -related impacts could worsen over time, \ninstitutions should be encouraged to take a long -term consideration of ESG -\nrelated financial risks and a proac tive dynamic risk management approach.  Guidelines provide that institutions should \nmonitor ESG risks on a continuous basis and \nimplement frequent monitoring of \ncounterparties and portfolios materially \nexposed to ESG risks.   No change  \nLevel of \napplication  The monitoring of metrics should be limited at the group level and such \nindicators and thresholds should be set at a sector or portfolio level rather \nthan at individual client or entity level.  The Guidelines apply in line with the level of \napplication specified under article 109 of \nCRD.  No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n133 \n \nProportionality  The reference to the reporting requirement for SNCIs is unclear and the \nlimited availability of ESG related data (in particular from SMEs) needs to be \ntaken into better account.  \nThe granular and frequent monitoring of counterparties cannot be \nimplemented for institutions that have a short -term lending business model \nor for leasing companies.  The Guidelines have clarified that SNCI s and \nother non -large banks  may monitor only a \nsubset of indicators.  \n Section 5.7 \nclarified  \nPara 72 (a)  The lack of data for historical losses should be considered.   \nHistorical losses should be monitored with specific indicators per type of ESG \nrisk and more focus should be put on the monitoring of the exposures to \nphysical climate risk.  This metric covers ESG risks hence also \nphysical risks. Data for historical losses may \nbe built progressively.   Wording \nclarified  \nPara 72 (b)  The KPI does not make sense at the NACE 1 aggregation level. The amount \nand share of sector -related income seems unsuitable to capture relevant ESG \nrisks as it is unrelated to the risks of counterparties.  \nInstitutions should monitor also investments in fossil fuels and other high \nimpact activities, besides the amount and share of income.  This metric can inform institutions on \npotential business model dependencies.  \nReference to a mount and share of exposures \nand income to fossi l fuel sector entities has \nbeen included.   Section 5.7 \namended.  \nPara 72 (c)  Risks need to be monitored at sectoral -based perimeter, to help make \nconnections with sectoral policies used to manage ESG risks.  See portfolio alignment section.  \n Section 5.7 \namended  \nPara 72 (d)  Scope 3 emissions are deemed currently challenging to be recorded due to \nlimited data availability . \nScope 3 financed emissions is a crucial metric to assess the exposure of \nfinancial institutions to transition risks and suggest to make it mandatory for \nevery sector and every portfolio.  \n \nA clear guidance and a consistent approach on Scope 3 emissions \nmethodologies are needed together with a request for qualitative \ninformation to complement the metric and interpret its evolution.  Data challenges are recognised but ongoing \nefforts e.g. CSRD should progressively \nalleviate them.  \nIt is considered more appropriate to focus on \nsectors and portfolios identified on the basis \nof the materiality assessment.  \n \nThe Guidelines have clarified that qualitative \ninformation should supplement the metric to \ninterpret its evolution.  Section 5.7 \namended  \nPara 72 (e)  The EBA should better specify how to define the percentage of \ncounterparties with whom the institution has engaged and institutions \nshould also report the objectives, the frequency and the governance behind \nthe engagement.  \n  Such aspects should be specified under banks \nengagement policies, see section 6.   \n Section 6 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n134 \n \nIt may be more suitable to refer to a volume measure, such as credit \nexposure and the proposed ratio is not risk -based metric.  A metric in form of a ratio informs about the \nlevel of progress achieved by the bank to \nengage clients as part of risk management.   \nPara 72 (f)  The GAR should not be included among the metrics to be monitored \nconsidering that i) it is not a risk management tool, ii) it does not reflect the \nsustainability profile of institutions, iii) there are issues with its calculation \nmethodology .  \n \n \n \nThe metric should be complemented with indicators showing the portion of \nexposures Taxonomy aligned based on the classification framework adopted \n(e.g. GFANZ, CBI or ACT Finance).  The objective of this metric is to compare \nTaxonomy -aligned exposures  for climate \nchange mitigation to carbon -intense \nexposures. However, due to methodological \nchallenges, metrics relating to adverse \nimpacts on other objectives of the Taxonomy \nhave been removed.  \nInstitutions may compute and monitor \nadditional metrics, such as based on different \nclassification frameworks adopted.  Section 5.7 \namended  \nPara 72 (h)  A reference to “water -stressed areas” risk among the physical risk drivers \nmentioned should be added.  It has been added as an example of physical \nrisk drivers.   Section 5.7 \namended  \nPara 72  Additional metrics are suggested:  \n• that reflect stakeholders' expectations regarding financial institu-\ntions' disclosures and their connection to real -economy transition \nplans;  \n• related to portfolio -level dependencies on water or natural capital;  \n• counterparties’ progress in doing their transition;  \n• low carbon CapEx;  \n• energy supply -banking ratio (ESBR);  \n• sustainable power supply to fossil fuel financing ratio;  \n• climate Value -at-Risk;  \n• metrics related to physical, nature and biodiversity;  \n• at portfolio level  \no portfolio alignment (by sector) with verified (externally) 1.5 \ndegree goals;  \no portfolio alignment of verified (externally) credible transi-\ntion plans;  The EBA has considered the suggestions and \nadjust ed the list of metrics. In particular, the \nfollowing metrics have been added:  \n- the energy supply banking ratio , \n- progress in the implementation of \nkey financing strategies , which may  \ninclud e financial flows towards finan-\ncial assets or counterparties that \nshare a common set of characteris-\ntics such as their alignment status \nrelative to the applicable regulatory \nsustainability objectives and/or insti-\ntution’s risk appetite  \n- exposures to fossil fuel sector enti-\nties and portfolio -level dependencies \non ecosystem services.  \n Section 5.7 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n135 \n \no proportion of “green” (with breakdown specifically to sus-\ntainable power solutions) and “transition” exposure (with a \ncomprehensive science -based definition);  \no proportion of fossil fuel (with breakdown of coal, oil, gas) ex-\nposure with and without credible transition plans;  \no proportion of high emitting hard -to-abate sector exposure \nwith and without credible transition plans (with a compre-\nhensive definition).  \n \nQuestion 18: Key principles for plans in accordance with Article 76(2) of the CRD  \n \nCRD vs CSRD \nplans  Several characteristics of comparability and interoperability between CRD \nand CSRD -related requirements on plans were raised:  \n- ESRS alignment: respondents expressed a range of views e.g. closer \n/ looser alignment (internal procedure only) / no guidance necessary  \n- CSRD is not a plan but the reporting of a plan...  \n- ...leading to expected unicity of plan – one transition plan with a risk \nside.  \n- Avoid CSRD / CRD confusion (naming, scope, ...)  \nIn addition, disclosure scope was mentioned:  \n- Only banks in CSRD and CSDDD scope should be required to disclose \ntheir CRD plans  The Guidelines in the background and section \n6 clarify that banks should ensure that their \nplans address forward -looking ESG risk \nmanagement aspects while being consistent \nwith other applicable requirements including \nthose stemming from CSRD and CSDDD. CRD \nplans are not subject to specific disclosure \nbut may partly be covered by other \ntransparency requirements.  Background and \nsection 6 \namended  \nSNCIs  SNCIs are only required to comply with the corresponding reporting \nobligations starting from the 2026 fiscal year if reporting is required for the \nfirst time. Therefore, it is recommended that any regulations for SNCIs should \nnot be provided before this deadline  The Guidelines provide a 1 -year phase -in for \nSNCIs to give additional time to implement \nnecessary changes , as well as several \nproportionality measures.  Section 6 \namended  \nLevel of \nprescriptiveness  Respon dents  asked for more or less prescriptiveness of the principles with \nadditional suggestions.  \nLess  prescriptiveness : \no More flexibility in the implementation of the plans, recognising the \ndifferent materiality of the risk for banks  See response s on level of prescriptiveness \nand on alignment with EU objectives in \ngeneral comments , and responses on \nmateriality assessment, portfolio alignment \nand risk management tools.  \n Section 6 \namended.  \n \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n136 \n \no GLs should focus on risk management tools and not on decarbonisa-\ntion, alignment or sectorial targets  \no The transition plans should not have in scope the business strategy  \no Reference to EU law should not be interpreted as a requirement to \nreduce emissions by 55% by 2030  \nMore  prescriptiveness : \n- On scope:  \no fossil fuels and other harmful activities  \no decarbonization strategy, targets and their quality/align-\nment.    \no elements related to financial planning  \no engagement activities and their consequences for compa-\nnies  \no link between plans and remuneration  \no due diligence requirement for banks.  \no the importance of supply chain analysis for banks  \no clarify sufficient capacity and resources (para 88.)  \no financial materiality should be better clarified.  \n- On method:  \no more emphasis should be given to risk acceptance and capi-\ntalisation of risks.  \no frequency of update of the plans  \no full ESG spectrum (e.g. E, S & G), their interdependencies \nacross relevant time horizons  \no reference to the EU climate law should be clarified ( e.g. 1990 \nbaseline)  With regard to other comments:  \n- exposures to fossil fuel sector enti-\nties should be considered as part of \nmateriality assessments, which form \nthe basis for transition planning;  \n- engagement including outcomes is \nmore clearly referred to in the key \ncontents of plans in section 6.4;  \n- remuneration policies are referred to \nin the key contents of plans, reflect-\ning new CRD6 provisions;  \n- the frequency of updates of plans is \nclarified in section 6.5 and aligned \nwith updates of strategies required \nby CRD;  \n- the scope of risks captured by each \npart of the plan should be specified \nas per paragraph 108.  \n \nNon -EU entities  Respondents asked for clarifications or raised concerns regarding the \ninclusion of non -EU entities in the scope of the requirements given that non -\nEU entities have lower data availability and face less ambitious climate \nregulation.

Section 6.2. \nclarified  \nSecond line  The (perceived equal role) role of compliance vs. risk management in the GLs \nis being challenged:  \no Respondents suggested the removal of the reference to the compli-\nance function from par. 86 b) as the risk limits referred to in this par-\nagraph are typically monitored by the risk management function.  \no In alignment with paragraphs 179 -187 of EBA Guidelines on internal \ngovernance (EBA/GL/2021/05), which assign to the risk management The reference to the compliance function has \nbeen removed from this paragraph to focus \non the role of the risk management function. \nThe compliance function’s responsibilities \nare specified  under section 5.4.  \n Section 6.2 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n138 \n \nfunction the responsibility of the risk management framework in-\ncluding assessing the consistency of risk appetites and limits with the \nrisk strategy  \nEngagement \nwith \ncounterparties \nwithout \ntransition plan  Precise the expected engagement with counterparties with no transition \nplan because of their size, location, local regulation etc.  The Guidelines require banks to determine, \njustify and document their engagement \npolicies, including their scope. Transition \nplans of counterparties should be leveraged, \nwhere available.  Section 5.1 and \nsection 6.2 \nclarified.  \n \nQuestion 20: Metrics and targets  \n \nTargets and \nMetrics – \nPurposes \n(Strategic versus \nPrudential \napproach)  The targets and metrics presented are strategic and unable to be used as risk \nmanagement tools. T he content of the plans will be guided by public policy \nobjectives aimed at carbon neutrality . Therefore, it does not appear clear \nhow the targets and metrics will aid banks in the assessment of prudential \nrisk.  \nTo solve this problem, two options could be considered:  \n- Paragraph 90 could be amended, by deleting “risk management and” \nor replacing “with a view to mitigating risks” with “with a view to \nachieve strategic goals”.  \n- In order for plans to both serve risk management and strategic steer-\ning purposes, metrics and targets could be defined as per the ESRS \nwith potential additional datapoints to fulfil specific requirements of \nthe prudential risk approach.   The metrics and targets in 5.7, 6.3 or 6.4 are \nmeant to focus on risk management  aspects \nsuch as integration in the risk management \nframework, assessment and monitoring of \nexposures  / emissions  / portfolios alignment,  \nengagement with clients etc. The choice of \nspecific targets is the responsibility of banks.  \nESRS are disclosure purpose based and CRD is \nfocused on prudential / risk aspects.  \nSee also response above on 5.7 and Annex \ntool for indicative ESRS references .  \n Section 6.3.4 \namended  \nPurposes \n(Physical risk)  A reference to physical risks could be added in paragraph 90 (“risks stemming \nfrom the physical impacts of changing climate”).  Physical risks are integral part of \nrequirements as set in background (para. 20 \n– 30), in 4.1 - materiality assessment (para. \n16), and metrics within 5.7 monitoring .   No change  \nTargets and \nmetrics – \nConsistency with \nCSRD  The guidelines should  require data based on ESRS  requirements. As of now, \nthe metrics and targets lack consistency with CSRD. More specifically, the \nEBA should  align the target -setting horizon of prudential plans with CSRD \n(2030 and 2050 instead of a short -term 3 -year horizon). Consistency with See responses above on data, time horizons \nand metrics. The 3 -years horizon reference \nhas been removed.  Section 6.3 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n139 \n \nfuture sector -specific ESRS for the financial sector should also be taken into \naccount.  The annex provides ESRS cross -references vs. \neach part of the 6.4 output plan.  \nTargets and \nmetrics – \nConsistency with \nNZBA  The guidelines are not consistent enough with voluntary commitments such \nas NZBA, especially because paragraph 94 raises concerns on the \nmethodology of alignment used (absolute vs relative emissions).  \nMoreover, it should be sufficient for CRD plans to refer to strategic climate \ntargets taken as voluntary commitments.  GLs set regulatory requirements for all \ninstitutions. Alignment metrics are requested  \nand may be computed based on emissions \nintensity . Consistency with voluntary \ncommitments is now mentioned . Section 6.1 \namended  \nConsistency with \nP3 The guidelines should be more consistent with Pillar 3 reports.  Some metrics and parts of plans are \ninterconnected with parts of Pillar 3  and \nwhere relevant consistency has been \nensured and references included in the \nAnnex . However, plans have their own, \ninternal risk management purpose  and go \nbeyond Pillar 3.  No change  \nTargets and \nmetrics – \nProportionality  This section of the guidelines could expressly recall the proportionality \nprinciple as compliance with this section would be disproportionate for small \nand medium -sized institutions.  Proportionality is recalled within several \nparts of the GLs and specifically in application \nof the metrics in 6.3.4 and 6.4.  Section 6.3 and \nsection 6.4 \namended  \nTargets – \nExtension of the \nscope of \nactivities \ncovered  The targets should cover all activities and jurisdictions and paragraph 89 \nshould be re -written as “all activities and business lines are covered by \ntargets and metrics”. Institutions should set specific sector -based targets for \nthe most environmentally ha rmful sectors. These targets should be based on \nthe evolution of the sector in a 1.5° no/low overshoot scenario (with limited \nvolume of negative emissions).  Metrics and targets – including sector \nalignment metrics – are meant to monitor \nand address material ESG risks identified on \nthe basis of comprehensive materiality \nassessments.  No change  \nTargets - \ndifferent scales  Cascading down the targets at economic activities level (i.e. individual \ntechnologies) seems too detailed and associated with uncertainties \nregarding data quality and availability . In some cases, metrics and targets can apply \nto specific economic activities.  Section 6.4 \nclarified  \nMetrics – \nOptional nature  The metrics should be viewed as suggestions, rather than compulsory. The \nguidelines are too prescriptive and would benefit from more flexibility given \nto institutions ( to tailor targets  and metrics  to the specific needs of each \ninstitution ). The guidelines should not require institutions to set  targets for \nmetrics that are based on specific scenarios (e.g. the IEA NZ2050 ). If The Guidelines require banks to consider the \nmetrics listed in 5.7 for the purpose of target \nsetting. Banks should determine, taking into \naccount their business strategies and risk \nappetite, which other risk -based and \nforward -looking metrics and targets th ey will Section 6.3.4 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n140 \n \nminimum requirements are kept, they should be concentrated to climate -\nrelated factors.  \n \nThe question of the limits to be set was also raised, with several respondents  \ncalling for targets and limits to be imposed only on the most relevant metrics.   include in their plans.  Banks are responsible \nfor setting specific targets levels. See also \nabove on IEA scenario.  \n \nMetrics – \nMandatory \nnature  The mandatory nature of metrics is welcomed. The EBA could even take \nfurther actions for a more prescriptive approach on the format and content \nof transition plans .  See response in row above.  Section 6.3.4 \namended  \nMetrics – \nNature -related \nrisks  The guidelines should include metrics related to nature -related risks \n(including by adopting a double materiality approach informed by the \nrecommendations of the TNFD) .  The Guidelines require banks to take steps to \nprogressively include metrics that support \nrisk assessment and strategic steering related \nto institutions ’ exposure to, and \nmanagement of,  environmental risks other \nthan climate -related, e.g. risks stemming \nfrom the degradation of  ecosystems  and \nbiodiversity  loss.  Section 6.3.4 \namended  \nMetrics - \nTransparency  Banks must be transparent with  the methodologies used to calculate metrics . CRD based plans are not required to be \ndisclosed. However, documentation of \nmetrics and plans is required in section 5.7 \nand section 6.4 . Section 5.7 and \nsection 6.4  \nclarified  \nMetrics – \nForward -looking \nnature  Point -in-time metrics might not be relevant and do not distinguish between \ninvestments in a high -emitting sector which are designed to decarbonise, \nversus those which finance the status quo. The guidelines need to lay out \nforward -looking metrics related to emissions such as Expe cted Emissions \nReductions (EER).  \nThe combination of both point -in-time and forward looking metrics is needed \nin order to get a “complete picture” of expected transition and physical risks \nexposures.  The GLs mention  that i nstitutions should \ncompute, use and monitor forward -looking \nESG risks metrics and indicators.  \nSee also amendments to section 5.7 in \nparticular on financed emissions (cf row \nbelow).  \n Section 5.7 and \nsection 6 \nclarified  \nMetrics – \nComments and \nproposed \nchanges  – Paragraph 94a) was subject to many proposals, among which:  \n- Consider consistency with the methodology developed under NZBA \n(targets are expressed as intensities and not as absolute emissions \nfor sectors other than oil and gas under NZBA methodology)  The metric related to financed emission has \nbeen amended.  \nPara. 94a) is now 81c) and includes:  \n Section 5.7 \namended.  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n141 \n \nFinanced \nemissions  - GHG emission intensity metrics can be misleading and should not be \nrequired (variety of formulas for calculating relative emissions, inten-\nsity per euros is misleading, need to reduce absolute emissions)  \n- Extend  emission coverage  to include facilitated emissions  \n- Emissions targets to be differentiated to cover individual sectors, as-\nset classes, and gases, as well as aggregated across portfolios, and \ngases (by using the metric of CO2 -equivalent).  \n- Consider a hierarchy with i. financed GHG emissions (absolute emis-\nsions, in tons CO2 equivalent, and where relevant in intensity per \nunit of production, or by default, intensity of revenues, associated \nwith a portfolio) and ii.

Section 5.7 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n142 \n \nMetrics – \nComments and \nproposed \nchanges – \nEnergy efficiency \nof collaterals  Regarding 94d), the following comments were made:  \no The lack of harmonization at EU level between EPC regulations is a \nstrong limit to the use of this metric.  \no Banks could also assess the financed emissions of their real estate \nassets (in addition to energy efficiency) . No mention of EPC anymore in the GLs.  \nChanged to:  \nEnergy efficiency . \n Section 5.7 \namended  \nMetrics – \nComments and \nproposed \nchanges – \nEngagement \nwith \ncounterparties  Paragraph 94e) could be amended to:  \nClarification:  \no Clarify the definitions of (positive) engagement and “percentage of \nborrowers”  \no Show a more direct connection with counterparties’ transition plans \n(“including in relation to counterparties’ transition plans”)  \nCounterparties:  \no Reflect that engagement should be performed for companies that \nneed to take further transition actions (concentration of engage-\nment on companies that are already sustainable would not mitigate \ntransition risk)  \no Limit the metric to counterparties that have been identified as ma-\nterial, are included in a portfolio subject to the alignment targets and \nare on the top of the consideration of the level of services the bank \nis providing to this counterpart  \nMetric:  \no Add a metric for the engagement stage the companies are in and dis-\nclose the cases where engagement was unsuccessful and led to di-\nvestment  \no Separate the metric into 2 indicators: (i)  the first focusing on moni-\ntoring the engagement activities of the institution, (ii) the other fo-\ncusing on monitoring the performance of counterparties  \nEvaluate progress observed over time against individual institution’s \ntransitio n plan assessment methodologies  Para. 94e) is now 81e):  \n \n- Clarification: The percentage of coun-\nterparties for which an assessment of \nESG risks has been performed, also as \nregards their transition strategies \nand where available transition plans  \n- There is no concept of material client \nbut banks should determine, justify \nand document the scope of engage-\nment  \n- A range of counterparty -specific ac-\ntions may be taken in line with sec-\ntion 5.1, this is reflected in  follow -up \nactions taken by the institution . \n \n Section 5.7 \namended  \nMetric – \nComments and Paragraph 96) proposed amendment:   Given the importance of both physical risks \nand concentration risks (from a transition Section 5.7 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n143 \n \nproposed \nchanges – \nParagraph 96  o Regarding physical risks, institutions should perform a comprehen-\nsive assessment that distinguishes between chronic and acute risk \nimpacts, across various climate scenarios, as well as appropriate \ngranularity depending on the use case.  \no Regarding ESG -related concentration risk, the work done is imma-\nture (the concept has not been yet defined in the regulation), which \ncould justify a phased implementation  and physical risks perspective), metrics \nrelated to these risks are included in 5.7.  \n \nMetrics – \nProposals for \nnew metrics  The guidelines could impose new metrics, such as:  \no Environment  \no Sector -specific  \no Indicators related to fossil fuel (e.g. forward -looking metrics regard-\ning the total portfolio exposure to fossil fuels, including details about \nhow this breaks down according to fossil fuel type (coal, oil, gas), \nvalue chain exposure (upstream, midstream, and storage), as well as \nregional breakd owns where possible)  \no An indicator on the sustainable power supply to fossil fuel financing \nratio (e.g. ESBR)  \no Indicators on sustainable exposures and carbon -intensive exposures \nmentioned in Section 5.8 paragraph 72  \no Proportion of high emitting hard -to-abate sector exposure with and \nwithout credible transition plans  \no Portfolio alignment (by sector) with verified 1.5 -degree goals and \nwith verified credible transition plans (verified externally)  \n \no Others  \no Financial projections, including revenue, Capital Expenditures \n(CAPEX) and Operational Expenditures (OPEX)  \no An indicator reflecting the Climate Value -at-Risk of counterparties \nunder a range of climate scenarios and across multiple time -horizons  \no Assessment of the emissions profile for mortgages and real estate \nassets  See response above on metrics included in \n5.7. \n \nThe GLs in paragraph 81 listing minimum \nmetrics is completed by paragraph 104:  \n \n- Institutions should determine, taking \ninto account their business strategies \nand risk appetite, which other risk -\nbased and forward -looking metrics \nand targets they will include in their \nplans with a view to monitoring and \naddressing ESG risks. This include s \nassessing, computing and using met-\nrics to evaluate the financial implica-\ntions of transition planning for insti-\ntutions’ business and risk profile  \n \n- In addition, the Annex supporting \ntool offers several examples of addi-\ntional metrics spanning E, S & G  \n  Section 5.7 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n144 \n \no Proportion of “green” exposures with breakdown specifically to sus-\ntainable power solutions  \no Proportion of “transition” exposures with a comprehensive science -\nbased definition  \no An indicator related to nature -related risks  \no An indicator related to the mitigation of physical risks  \no An indicator that requires to show the consistency between sustain-\nability -related risk targets and impact targets  \n \n• Social & Governance  \no Indicators related to remuneration (e.g. proportion of individuals \nwith remuneration linked to transition plan progress) or training (e.g. \npercentage of staff receiving transition plan -related training)  \no Indicators inspired by social and governance Principal Adverse Im-\npact indicators of SFDR as well as social and governance metrics of \nCSRD ESRS  \n \nQuestion 21: Climate and environmental scenarios and pathways  \n \nGeneral \ncomments – \nProportionality  The requirements set in Section 6.4 might not be suitable for small and \nmedium -sized institutions. Paragraph 97 is seen as too detailed and \nparagraph 97a should be the only paragraph formulated as binding for SNCIs.  \nAs paragraph 98 requires a significant amount of information to fulfil these \nrequirements, the EBA should consider a phased approach to \nimplementation.  The Guidelines now provide that the \ncomplexity of the scenarios should be \nproportional to the size and complexity of \ninstitutions. Non -large institutions  may rely \non a simplified set of main parameters and \nassumptions, included risks, time horizons \nconsidered, and regional breakdown of \nimpacts.  Section 6.3.1 \namended  \nGeneral \ncomments – \nBinding nature  The EBA should specify that the list  of scenarios mentioned  is representative \nand not mandatory.  If scenarios are publicly recognized and science -based, \nbanks should be given more flexibility.  The Guidelines do not preclude and even ask \nbanks to use public, science -based scenarios. \nScenarios may now be nationa l on top of EU \nor international. See also above on portfolio \nalignment assessments.  Section 6.3.1 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n145 \n \nType of \nscenarios / \nSuggestions for \nadding new \nscenarios  The EBA should consider including NGFS, IPCC and the scenarios used for the \nFit-for-55 exercise as sources for publicly available scenarios. The guidelines \nshould also explicitly mention that banks are allowed to develop their own \ninternally designed scena rios.  \n It could also be useful to encourage banks to also use worst -case scenarios \nand clarify the need to use among the different scenarios those with high tail \nrisks.  \nThe guidelines should also consider scenarios where financed NFCs won't be \nable to timely achieve a transition that is fully aligned with benchmark one.  See above on portfolio alignment methods.  \nThe guidelines now further emphasise that \nbanks should understand their sensitivity to \nESG risks under different scenarios and \nunderstand how different scenarios may \naffect their transition planning efforts.  \n Section 6.3.1 \namended  \nType of \nscenarios / \nClarifications \nexpected from \nthe EBA  Risk management and strategic steering as different use cases for climate \nscenarios and pathways would require banks to also consider “real -world” \nprojections of decarbonisation trajectories in addition to “normative” \npathways (such as the IEA Net zero emission scenario).  \nMoreover, the guidelines should specify that a uniform scenario does not \nnecessarily have to be used on a company -wide basis, as different \njurisdictions have different transition pathways.  See above on the clarification regarding \nconsideration of different scenarios. In \naddition, the Guidelines provide that the \ngeographical reference and granularity, such \nas in terms of regional breakdowns, of the \nscenarios and pathways used by institutions \nshould be relevant to their business model \nand exposures.  Section 6.3.1 \namended  \nType of \nscenarios / \nGlobal vs. \nregional \nscenarios  The publicly available scenarios quoted do generally not provide regional \nbreakdowns (global scenarios). Reflecting geographical aspects and \ngranularity will require the consideration of additional or alternative \nscenarios.  \nMoreover, national authorities often publish their own scenarios, which \nmight be more tailored to portfolios with a national focus. These scenarios in \nline with EU objectives could offer valuable data.  See above for: national consideration, \ngeographical differences.  \nFurthermore, para. 95 provides : addressing \nthe specific environmental risks that may \nstem from the process of adjustment \ntowards the climate and environmental -\nrelated regulatory objectives of the \njurisdictions where they operate.  Section 6.3.1 \namended  \nNegative \nemissions / \nclimate \novershoot  The EBA should provide clear guidance specifying that the method ology must \nbe based on a 1.5 °C scenario with no or low overshoot  and with limited \nreliance  of negative emissions . Para. 95b) refers to para. 38, which r equires  \nsectoral decarbonisation pathways to be \nconsistent with the applicable policy \nobjective, such as the EU objective to reach \nnet-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and to \nreduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n146 \n \nto the 1990 level, or any national objective \nwhere applicable.  \nIn addition, methodological choices should \nbe justified and documented.  \nLimitations in \nthe use of \nscenarios  The guidelines should identify explicitly limitations in the use of scenarios. \nThe economic models used for climate scenarios analysis were developed to \ndeal with traditional financial risks and are not suitable for climate -related \nrisks . Tipping points and feedback mechanisms are not modelled and the \nmodels ignore some severe impacts of climate change (sea -level rise, \nmigration, etc). The risks could therefore be underestimated.  Each scenario comes with its own limitation \nin both design and application. Banks should \nunderstand implications of different \nscenarios, as set out in these GLs and future \nGLs on scenario analysis.  \n Section 6.3.1 \namended  \nTransparency  Institutions should provide  transparency on the underlyin g model choices \nand assumptions.  Disclosure is out of scope but banks should \njustify and document their methodological \nchoices . No change  \n \nQuestion 22: Section 6.5 – transition planning  \n \nStructure & \nrelation with \nother sections  The structure of Section 6.5 should be reviewed for further clarity. In \nparticular, the EBA could establish clearer links with sections 6.1 and 6.2, \nwhose themes are closely interrelated with transition planning.  The structure of section 6 has been reviewed \nincluding to specify transition planning \naspects before setting out the key contents \nof plans.  Section 6 \nrestructured  \nAlignment of the \nsection with \nGFANZ \nframework  Section 6.5 could be aligned with the GFANZ framework by grouping \nparagraphs 101, 102, 104 and 105 under the heading “Implementation \nStrategy Section” and paragraph 103 as the “Engagement Strategy Section” \nin order to provide a visible signal of internatio nal consistency.  Section 6.4 detailing the key contents of \nplans now includes two parts catering for \nimplementation and engagement (para. \n109d) e)).  Section 6.4 \namended  \nEngaging with \ncounterparties – \nClarifications \nneeded  The guidelines should stress the importance of engagement  as the main \ndriver of a transition plan (as scope 3 represents most of a bank's emissions) . \nIt would therefore seem worthwhile clarifying some of the EBA's \nexpectations, including  the definition of engagement, based on time -bound \nobjectives and an escalation strategy (incl. exit strategy).  Section 6.4 includes requirements for \nengagement, including policies, processes \nand outcomes. See also response on section \n5.1. \n Section 6.4 \namended  \nEngaging with \ncounterparties – \nDifficulties raised  The requirements set by the EBA are too extensive (reviewing counterparties \ntransition plans is seen as very resource intensive, whereas banks could rely \non ESG scores instead for instance).  See answers provided above on \ncounterparties engagement.  Section 5.1 and \nsection 6 \namended  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n147 \n \ncounterparties \nplans  – Scope \ntoo narrow  Requesting transition pl ans for only large counterpartie s might generat e a \nportfolio -level blind spot. Moreover, the exclusion of financial corporates in \nparagraph 102 is not justified.  See answers provided above on the scope of \nclient engagement.  Section 5.1 and \nsection 6 \namended  \ncounterparties \nplans  – Scope \ntoo large  Difficulties with the engagement process were raised, including the fact that \nit is not possible to engage with all clients. One way of solving this issue would \nbe to implement a phased approach. These difficulties are further \nexacerbated f or institutions that have a short -term lending business  model.  See answers provided above on the scope of \nclient engagement.  Section 5.1 and \nsection 6 \namended  \ncounterparties \nplans – \nVerification of \ncounterparty \nactions  External verification of counterparties transition plans should be encouraged \nto enhance credibility. The plan should be accompanied by an annual Scope \n1, 2 and 3 emissions inventory that is complete, accurate, transparent, \nconsistent, relevant and verified by a third party. Moreover, the guidelines \nshould define the way the bank entails course corrections when the plan is \nproven infeasible.  See answers provided above on the bank’s \nresponsibility to assess the risk profile of \ncounterparties.  No change  \nTransition \nplanning \nprocesses  Further details could be provided for certain aspects, such as clarification on \nhow to assess the implications of transition planning on the business and risk \nprofile s.  \nTransition planning processes could be presented more precisely, by \ndescribing them as the collection of interoperable metrics from corporates \nand setting interim targets.  Transition planning has been reviewed and \nexpanded . \nAn expected roadmap with interim \nobjectives is present in 6.4  \n Section 6 \namended  \nThe role of banks  \nin the transition  Even though institutions play a key role in the transition process, the role \ngiven to banks is too broad. Se ction 6.5 seems to suggest that the task of \ntransition is exclusively reserved for banks . It is therefore seen as too far -\nreaching to ask banks to consider “ adjustments to the product offering, the \nagreement of an action plan and remediation measures to support an \nimproved transition path for the counterparty ” (paragraph 103).  The guidelines and the range of actions listed \nas potential risk management tools aim at \nsupporting banks’ safety and soundness, \nincluding in the process of the transition.  No change  \n \nQuestion 23: Level of granularity for the plans  \n \nAreas needing \nmore details  On top of answers stating “more details needed” without further precision, \nrespondents highlighted the need for more details on transition plan \ncredibility.  Transition planning (now section 6.3) has \nbeen fully revamped and their output (6.4) \nare specified with more details.  \n Section 6 \namended  \n \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n148 \n \nIn addition, sector (e.g. fossil fuels) commitments / action plan should be \nmore detailed, including carbon offsets management.  \nS&G would deserve more details.  \nFinally, inter alia, targets, governance, monitoring or materiality assessment \nwere cited as needing more details.   \nAreas too \ndetailed (and \nwhy)  Few respondents thought the guidelines were too detailed with too many \nrules and should remain high level – need for flexibility and principles -based \nguidelines, especially on transition plan, decarbonisation strategies, ESG risk \nmetrics …  \nThe guidelines were also deemed too detailed and overwhelming for SNCIs / \nLSIs.  Para. 110 caters specifically for SNCIs with \nless requirements in the plans content (6.4).  \n Section 6.4 \namended  \n \nQuestion 24: Common format for the plans required by the CRD  \n \nGeneral views  The answers were quite polarised with most respondents asking for a \ncommon format type of template, while other respondents having a negative \nview on the proposal.  \nMany positive respondents did not elaborate except it would improve \ninteroperability with greater standardisation including proportionality for \nSNCIs.  \nInduced qualities brought by a potential template were: Comparability; \nEfficiency / cost; Consistency; Ease of approval / review  \nOn the negative side, demand for flexibility dominates and a loose (or \nNZBA’s) framework catering for every need is preferred.  \nThere was no specific trend expressed on the structure or tool to be \nconsidered for the common format but some features mostly around \ninteroperability.  Taking into account the comments received, \nthe EBA has decided to include a supporting \ntool for institutions in the Annex. This does \nnot introduce additional requirements but \nprovides for each key content required by the \nguidelines some examples, reference s and \npotential metrics that institutions may \nconsider as they structure and formalise their \nplans. Institutions may adapt the format of \nthis common approach provided they ensure \nthat all required key contents are included in \ntheir plans.  \n Annex included  \nImproving \ninteroperability  Most of the ideas proposed invokes a starting or mixed format including \nother EU requirements (at least CSRD / ESRS) to be complemented by CRD \nplans or at least a conversion table between ESRS and EBA GL is mentioned.  \nKey is to align targets, metrics, KPIs…or at least leverage same data across \nframeworks.  The annex supporting tool provides \nreferences to CSRD / ESRS to foster \ninterconnections and consistency.  \n Annex included  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n149 \n \nSome respondents recall it is the transition plan expected role to unify the \nframeworks.  \n \nQuestion 25: Other challenges  \n \nCapital neutrality  It is important to ensure that transition to a net zero economy is capital \nneutral. Regulators have the opportunity to deliver capital relief to those \nbanks delivering on credible transition plans. A capital add -on only approach \nfor ESG risks will be a missed opportunity.  The Guidelines do not address supervisory \nmeasures such as capital add -ons.   No change  \nRisk \nmethodology \ncomplexity  The guidelines propose a combination of methodologies, including exposure -\nbased, portfolio -based, and scenario -based, to measure ESG risks. \nImplementing and integrating these approaches might pose challenges due \nto their complexity and the level of expertise required.   \nThere should be sufficient clear instructions for banks to integrate ESG \nfactors into credit, market, operational risk models.  With many of these \ntopics (outside of climate) being at early stage of development, we see a \npotential risk that individual institutions will follow fairly different routes and \napproaches.  \nAdditional tools or frameworks, particularly for the complex methodologies \nsuggested for ESG risk assessment should be provided. Providing more \nexamples and use cases can certainly improve the understanding of the \ndocument and facilitate the application of  the rules by the institution.  \nMore explicit guidance on predicting and preparing for future ESG risks, \nincluding potential changes in technology, regulations, or industry practices \nwould help.  The Guidelines provide harmonised \nrequirements on the types of methodologies, \nand main features for each type, to be used \nby institutions to assess ESG risks. Given data \nand methodological developments, \ninstitutions should improve practices and \ndevelop the ir own complementary methods \nover time. Institutions remain responsible to \nproperly understand, assess and manage \nrisks they face, including ESG risks.  \n No change but \nalso see above \non section 4.2  \n \nQuestion 26: Other comments  \n \n \nSupervisory gold \nplating  As the EBA has already flagged that the Guidelines will be eventually \nintegrated into the SREP, institutions should not expect to have to meet a \nsecondary set of supervisory expectations on top of the Guidelines’  \nrequirements.   The EBA SREP G uidelines  will be addressed to \ncompetent authorities  and not include  \nrequirements for institutions.  \n No change  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n150 \n \n \nIntegrate \ntransition plans \nin other sections  As transition plans are recognised by the Guidelines as a risk management \ntool, provisions on transition plans should be integrated into the respective \nsections on materiality assessment, risk management, monitoring, \ngovernance, ILAAP and ICAAP - rather th an being singled out in the section \n6, which led to certain requirements being duplicative/overlapping . The EBA has considered several options. \nIntegrating requirements on plans in a \ndedicated section of the Guidelines allows to \nprovide clarity on all requirements, which \nshould be read in conjunction. Duplications \nhave been removed and cross -references \nadded . Section 6 \namended  \nRecognise \ngovernance \nstructures  The Guidelines should recognize differences in institutional setups and allow \nroom for implementation in accordance with existing governance structures . The Guidelines should be applied by banks \nregardless of their governance structure. See \nGuidelines on internal governance.  No change  \nMutualisation of \nbanks’ data \ncollection  In order to avoid high reporting burden f or corporates, it could be relevant  \nto suggest financial institution s to rely on mutualization of efforts (e.g. \nmutualized questionnaire, common initiatives…)?  The banking industry might explore such \navenue. The Guidelines list certain data \npoints to consider for the assessment of ESG \nrisks, hence supporting harmonisation.  No change  \nEngagement \nwith \nstakeholders  We recommend continuous engagement with industry stakeholders to keep \nthe Guidelines  relevant and practical , including by involving employees and \ntrade unions in the development , implementation and update process of the \nGuidelines.  The EBA engages with stakeholders and will \nconduct public consultations in case of future \nupdates .  No change  \nRisk neutrality of \npublic \nadministration  The Public Administration (i.e. central governments, regional governments, \nlocal authorities and public sector entities) should  be considered ESG  risk \nneutral and therefore excluded from risk assessments  for the following \nreasons: high availability of public funds for climate emergencies, exclusion \nof expenses for emergencies from public budget deficit, essential public \nservices mechanism, interventions to support public services continuity and \nsustainabi lity, exclusion from EU Taxonomy.  Banks should assess ESG risks stemming from \nexposures towards various types of \ncounterparties, taking into account specific \nrisk mitigating factors.  \n No change  \nRegulatory risk \nto banks  Regulatory risk  could be added in the risk descriptions, as  authorities and \npolitics increasingly seem to view the bank and finance industry as part of \nthe \"solution\" or a part of the toolbox. This results in increased obligations \nand expectations for the industry also in non -bank regulations (e.g., the \nbuilding en ergy directive, potentially in the deforestation regulation, etc.).   The Guidelines require banks to take into \naccount regulatory developments as part of \nrisk management and transition planning.  Section 6 \nclarified  \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n151 \n \nReal economy \ntransition  The real economy is still at the beginning of its transitioning process. Hence, \nESG transition also in the financial sector remains a challenge, most likely \nover several years to come. This needs to be taken into consideration.  As part of the range of considerations to \nsupport strategy and risk management \ndecision -making, banks should consider the \nreal economy transition progress.   \nUNGPs and \nOECD MNE \nGuidelines  The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and OECD \nGuidelines for Multinational Enterprises (OECD MNE Guidelines) provide a \ncommon reference point for responsible business conduct including as it \nrelates to environment and social sustainability. All businesses, including \nfinancial market participants, have a responsibility to respect human rights \nand that should be implemented through a process of human rights due \ndiligence. The UNGPs and OECD MNE Guidelines have gained wide legitimacy \nand are referenced in ESG related EU regulation . The Guidelines require banks to implement \ndue diligence processes with a view to \nassessing financial impacts stemming from S \nand G  factors, taking into account the \nadherence of corporate counterparties to \nsocial and governance standards , including \nthe UNGPs and OECD MNE Guidelines.  \n Section 4.2 \namended  \n \n \n \n"

Dasselbe gilt für den Erwerb von Anteilen an Gesellschaften, zu deren Vermögen unmittelbar\noder mittelbar eine inländische Immobilie gehört. Übergibt der Schuldner Bargeld, Gold, Platin oder Edelsteine\noder überträgt er Kryptowerte als Gegenleistung, kann er diese nach den Vorschriften des Bürgerlichen\nGesetzbuchs über die Herausgabe einer ungerechtfertigten Bereicherung herausverlangen; die §§ 815 und 817\nSatz 2 des Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuchs sind nicht anzuwenden.\n(2) Bei Rechtsgeschäften nach Absatz 1 Satz 1 haben die Beteiligten gegenüber dem Notar, der den Antrag\nauf Eintragung des Erwerbers als Eigentümer oder Erbbauberechtigter beim Grundbuchamt einreichen soll,\nnachzuweisen, dass die Gegenleistung mit anderen Mitteln als Bargeld, Kryptowerten, Gold, Platin oder\nEdelsteinen erbracht wurde.

Er darf den Antrag auf\nEintragung des Erwerbers als Eigentümer oder Erbbauberechtigter beim Grundbuchamt erst stellen, wenn er\n1.   in Bezug auf den Nachweis\na)   dessen Schlüssigkeit festgestellt hat oder\n \nb)   in dem Fall, in dem ihm in angemessener Zeit nach der Fälligkeit der Gegenleistung kein\nschlüssiger Nachweis vorgelegt wurde, die Beteiligten erfolglos zur Vorlage des Nachweises\ninnerhalb einer angemessenen Frist aufgefordert hat und\n \n \n2.   in dem Fall, in dem er nach § 43 Absatz 1 zu einer Meldung verpflichtet ist, diese Meldung abgegeben hat\nund § 46 dem mit der Maßgabe nicht entgegensteht, dass die Transaktion frühestens durchgeführt werden\ndarf, wenn der fünfte Werktag nach dem Abgangstag der Meldung verstrichen ist.\n \n- Seite 28 von 77 -\nEin Service des Bundesministeriums der Justiz sowie des Bundesamts für\nJustiz ‒ www.gesetze-im-internet.de\n(4) Soweit bei Rechtsgeschäften nach Absatz 1 Satz 1 die Gegenleistung nach der Vereinbarung der Beteiligten\nvollständig oder teilweise erst nach der Einreichung des Eintragungsantrags zu erbringen ist, hat der Notar\ndie Schlüssigkeit des Nachweises innerhalb angemessener Zeit nach Fälligkeit zu prüfen. Werden innerhalb\neines Jahres nach Einreichung des Eintragungsantrags mehrere Teilleistungen fällig, kann der Notar nach Ablauf\neines Jahres eine Prüfung der Schlüssigkeit des Nachweises hinsichtlich der bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt fällig\ngewordenen Teilleistungen vornehmen. Bedarf es zur Bestimmung des Datums der Fälligkeit der Kenntnis von\nUmständen, die dem Notar bei der Antragstellung nicht bekannt sind, haben die Beteiligten den Notar über diese\nUmstände nachträglich zu informieren. Hinsichtlich des vor der Eintragung fällig werdenden Anteils richtet sich\ndie Prüfpflicht nach Absatz 3. Absatz 2 gilt entsprechend. Wurde dem Notar in angemessener Zeit nach der\nFälligkeit der Gegenleistung oder nach dem in Satz 2 geregelten Zeitpunkt kein schlüssiger Nachweis vorgelegt,\nso hat er die Beteiligten zur Vorlage des Nachweises innerhalb einer angemessenen Frist aufzufordern. Soweit\ndie Gegenleistung später als ein Jahr nach der Einreichung des Eintragungsantrags zu erbringen ist, entfällt die\nPrüfpflicht nach Satz 1.\n(5) Die Absätze 2 bis 4 gelten nicht, wenn die geschuldete Gegenleistung einen Betrag von 10 000 Euro nicht\nübersteigt oder soweit sie über ein Anderkonto des mit der Einreichung des Eintragungsantrags beauftragten\nNotars erbracht wird.

Insbesondere steht eine im Einzelfall abweichende Definition der Steuerstraftaten, die nach\nnationalem Recht eine taugliche Vortat zur Geldwäsche sein können, einem Informationsaustausch mit zentralen\nMeldestellen anderer Mitgliedstaaten der Europäischen Union nicht entgegen. Geht bei der Zentralstelle für\nFinanztransaktionsuntersuchungen eine Meldung nach § 43 Absatz 1 ein, die die Zuständigkeit eines anderen\nMitgliedstaates betrifft, so leitet sie diese Meldung umgehend an die zentrale Meldestelle des betreffenden\nMitgliedstaates weiter.

Die Verantwortung für die Zulässigkeit der Datenübermittlung trägt die Zentralstelle für\nFinanztransaktionsuntersuchungen. Für den Datenaustausch mit zentralen Meldestellen anderer Mitgliedstaaten\nnutzt die Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen gesicherte Kommunikationskanäle.\n(3) Sind zusätzliche Informationen über einen in Deutschland tätigen Verpflichteten, der in einem anderen\nMitgliedstaat der Europäischen Union in einem öffentlichen Register eingetragen ist, erforderlich, richtet die\nZentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen ihr Ersuchen an die zentrale Meldestelle dieses anderen\nMitgliedstaates der Europäischen Union. Geht bei der Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen\nein Ersuchen einer zentralen Meldestelle eines anderen Mitgliedstaates um zusätzliche Informationen über\neinen in ihrem Hoheitsgebiet tätigen Verpflichteten ein, der in Deutschland eingetragen ist, so nutzt die\nZentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchen die ihr nach diesem Gesetz zur Erhebung und Weiterleitung von\nInformationen zustehenden Befugnisse. Die Übermittlung von Anfragen und Antworten nach den Sätzen 1 und 2\nhat unverzüglich zu erfolgen.\n(4) Die Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen darf ein Ersuchen um Informationsübermittlung, das\neine zentrale Meldestelle eines Mitgliedstaates der Europäischen Union im Rahmen ihrer Aufgabenerfüllung an sie\ngerichtet hat, nur ablehnen, wenn\n1.   durch die Informationsübermittlung die innere oder äußere Sicherheit oder andere wesentliche Interessen\nder Bundesrepublik Deutschland gefährdet werden könnten,\n \n2.   im Einzelfall die Informationsübermittlung, auch unter Berücksichtigung des öffentlichen Interesses an der\nDatenübermittlung, mit den Grundprinzipien des deutschen Rechts nicht in Einklang zu bringen ist,\n \n3.   durch die Informationsübermittlung strafrechtliche Ermittlungen oder die Durchführung eines\nGerichtsverfahrens behindert oder gefährdet werden könnten oder\n \n4.   rechtshilferechtliche Bedingungen ausländischer Stellen entgegenstehen, die von den zuständigen\nBehörden zu beachten sind.\n \nDie Gründe für die Ablehnung des Informationsersuchens legt die Zentralstelle für\nFinanztransaktionsuntersuchungen der ersuchenden zentralen Meldestelle angemessen schriftlich dar, außer\nwenn die operative Analyse noch nicht abgeschlossen ist oder soweit die Ermittlungen hierdurch gefährdet\nwerden könnten.\n(5) Übermittelt die Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen einer zentralen Meldestelle eines\nMitgliedstaates der Europäischen Union auf deren Ersuchen Informationen, so soll sie in der Regel umgehend\nund unabhängig von der Art der Vortaten, die damit in Zusammenhang stehen können, ihre Einwilligung\ndazu erklären, dass diese Informationen an andere Behörden dieses Mitgliedstaates weitergeleitet werden\ndürfen. Die Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen darf ihre Einwilligung nur aus den in Absatz\n4 genannten Gründen verweigern. Die Gründe für die Verweigerung der Einwilligung legt die Zentralstelle für\nFinanztransaktionsuntersuchungen angemessen dar. Die Verwendung der Informationen zu anderen Zwecken\nbedarf der vorherigen Zustimmung der Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen.\n(6) Die Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen benennt eine zentrale Kontaktstelle, die für die\nAnnahme von Informationsersuchen der zentralen Meldestellen anderer Mitgliedstaaten nach dieser Vorschrift\nzuständig ist.\n§ 34 Informationsersuchen im Rahmen der internationalen Zusammenarbeit\n(1) Die Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen kann die zentralen Meldestellen anderer Staaten, die\nmit der Verhinderung, Aufdeckung und Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche, von Vortaten der Geldwäsche sowie von\nTerrorismusfinanzierung befasst sind, um die Erteilung von Auskünften einschließlich der personenbezogenen\nDaten oder der Übermittlung von Unterlagen ersuchen, wenn diese Informationen und Unterlagen erforderlich\nsind zur Erfüllung ihrer Aufgaben.\n(2) Für ein Ersuchen kann die Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen personenbezogene Daten\nübermitteln, soweit dies erforderlich ist, um ein berechtigtes Interesse an der begehrten Information glaubhaft zu\nmachen und wenn überwiegende berechtigte Interessen des Betroffenen nicht entgegenstehen.\n(3) In dem Ersuchen muss die Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen den Zweck der Datenerhebung\noffenlegen und die beabsichtigte Weitergabe der Daten an andere inländische öffentliche Stellen mitteilen.\nDie Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen darf die von einer zentralen Meldestelle eines anderen\nStaates übermittelten Daten nur verwenden\n- Seite 50 von 77 -\nEin Service des Bundesministeriums der Justiz sowie des Bundesamts für\nJustiz ‒ www.gesetze-im-internet.de\n1.   zu den Zwecken, zu denen um die Daten ersucht wurde, und\n \n2.   zu den Bedingungen, unter denen die Daten zur Verfügung gestellt wurden.\n \nSollen die übermittelten Daten nachträglich an eine andere öffentliche Stelle weitergegeben werden oder für\neinen Zweck genutzt werden, der über die ursprünglichen Zwecke hinausgeht, so ist vorher die Zustimmung der\nübermittelnden zentralen Meldestelle einzuholen.\n§ 35 Datenübermittlung im Rahmen der internationalen Zusammenarbeit\n(1) Geht bei der Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen eine Meldung nach § 43 Absatz 1 ein, die die\nZuständigkeit eines anderen Staates betrifft, so kann sie diese Meldung umgehend an die zentrale Meldestelle\ndes betreffenden Staates weiterleiten.

Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 3 of 22  \nAT1 1 Preliminary remarks \n \n1 This Circular provides a flexible, hands-on framework for risk management at institutions \nbased on section 25a (1) of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz – KWG). Further-\nmore it refines the requirements placed on a proper business organisation for the outsourced activities and processes pursuant to section 25a (2) KWG. Within the meaning of this Circu-\nlar, risk management–taking into account the institution’s risk-bearing capacity–includes in \nparticular the determination of appropriate strategies, as well as the establishment of appro-priate internal surveillance procedures. The inte rnal surveillance procedures comprise the in-\nternal control system and internal audit.In particular, the internal control system covers \n \n- rules regarding the organisational and operational structure and - processes for identifying, assessing, treating, monitoring and communicating risks. \n \nTo this extent, this Circular aims primarily to ensure the establishment of appropriate inter-nal governance structures. This also means that the supervisory body is involved as appro-\npriate to ensure that it can perform its supervisory duties properly. \n2 The Circular also provides a qualitative framework for the implementation of Articles 22 and \n123 of the Directive 2006/48/EC (Capital Requir ements Directive (CRD)). These provisions \nstate that institutions have to set up appropriate ‘Robust Governance Arrangements’, as well \nas strategies and processes that ensure adequate internal capital to cover all material risks \n(“Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Proce ss”). The Supervisory Authority shall assess \nthe quality of these processes on a regular ba sis in accordance with Article 124 of the CRD \n(“Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process”). As a result, and taking into account the prin-\nciple of double proportionality, this Circular shall provide a regulatory framework for the new \nqualitative supervisory system in Germany (“Supervisory Review Process”). With regard to \nthe new methods for the calculation of regulatory own funds in accordance with the CRD, the \nrequirements of this Circular have been formul ated in a neutral manner, to the extent that \ncompliance is possible irrespective of the method chosen. The Supervisory Authority expects audits to be in-line with the flexible overall structure of the Circular. As a result, audits have \nto be performed based on a risk-oriented approach. \n3 By way of section 33 (1) of the Securities Trading Act (WpHG) in conjunction with section \n25a (1) KWG this Circular also implements Art. 13 of the Directive 2004/39/EC (Markets in \nFinancial Instruments Directive) provided it is likewise applicable to credit institutions and fi-\nnancial services institutions. This regards the general organisational requirements pursuant to Art. 5, as well as the risk management and internal audit requirements pursuant to Art. 7 \nand 8, the requirements relative to management board responsibility pursuant to Art. 9 and \nto outsourcings pursuant to Art. 13 and 14 of the Directive 2006/73/EC (Implementing Di-rective for the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive). These requirements serve to achieve the objective of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, namely to harmonise \nthe financial markets in the European Union in the interests of cross-border financial services \nand to converge investor-protection standards. \n4 This Circular gives due consideration to the diversity of institutional structures and business \nactivities. It contains several opening clauses which enable simplified implementation de-\npending on the size of the institution, its core business activities and its risk profile. In par-ticular, this permits flexible implementation for smaller institutions. This Circular is open to \nthe ongoing development of risk management pr ocesses and procedures, provided that such \ndevelopment does comply with the objectives of the Circular. In this context, the Supervi-sory Authority will maintain an ongoing dialogue with the industry. \n5 The Supervisory Authority expects audits to be in line with the flexible overall structure of \nthe Circular. As a result, audits have to be  performed based on a risk-oriented approach. \n6 The Circular has a modular structure so that any necessary adaptations to individual regula-\ntory sections can be confined to the immediate overhaul of individual modules. A general \npart (AT module) provides basic principles for risk management. Specific requirements with \n                                       \n1 The abbreviations referring to the corresponding parts of the modular structure of the MaRisk are adopted in \nthe English text as given in the original text (AT = Ge neral Part; BT = Special Part; BTO = Special Part regard-\ning requirements for the organisational  and operational structure; BTR = Spec ial Part referring to the processes \nfor identifying, assessing, treating, monitoring and communicating certain risks) \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 4 of 22 regard to the organisation of the lending and trading business, as well as those relating to \nthe identification, assessment, management, monitoring and communicating of counterparty risks, market price risks, liquidity risks and operational risks are set forth in a special part \n(BT module). The latter also provides a framework for the internal audit of institutions. \n \nAT 2 Scope of application \n1 The institutions’ compliance with this Circular’s requirements is intended to contribute to the \nelimination of deficiencies in the banking and financial services industries which may jeop-ardise the security of the assets entrusted to th e institutions or impair the proper conduct of \nbanking transactions or financial services, or which may create substantial disadvantages for \nthe economy as a whole. When performing secu rities services and ancillary securities ser-\nvices the institutions must also comply with the requirements subject to the proviso that \nthey protect the interests of the securities service customer. \n \nAT 2.1 Affected institutions \n \n1 The requirements of this Circular are to be observed by all institutions within the meaning of \nsections 1 (1b) or 53 (1) KWG. They also appl y to the foreign branches of German institu-\ntions. They do not apply to branches of comp anies domiciled in another state of the Euro-\npean Economic Area pursuant to section 53b KWG. The parent company or the parent finan-\ncial conglomerate company of a group of institutions, a financial holding group or a financial \nconglomerate have to set up a procedure to en sure that material risks at group level are \ntreated and monitored appropriately and in accordance within the restrictions set by com-\npany law. \n2 Financial services institutions and securities trading banks have to comply with the require-\nments of the Circular to the extent that this appears necessary, based on the size of the in-\nstitution and the nature, scale, complexity and risk content of its business activities, in order \nto ensure compliance with the statutory obligations in accordance with section 25a KWG. This applies in particular to the mo dules AT 3, AT 5, AT 7 and AT 9. \n3 The requirements set forth in this Circular apply to investment companies within the mean-\ning of section 2 (6) of the Investment Act ( Investmentgesetz ) subject to the proviso that \na) BTO 1 does not apply to investment companies, \nb) BTO 2 and BTR do not apply to activities and processes related to fund management \nand individual asset management; the requir ements contained in these modules apply \nonly mutatis mutandis to activities and processes related to the investment company’s own account business, \nc) the requirements contained in the AT only apply to the extent that they are not explic-\nitly defined in special frameworks of rules and regulations for investment companies.  \n \nAT 2.2 Risks \n \n1 The requirements set forth in this Circular rela te to the management of material risks of the \ninstitution, as well as risk concentrations associated with these risks. In order to assess whether or not a risk is deemed material, the management has to obtain an overview of the \noverall risk profile of the institution. \nAs a general rule, the types of risk to be taken into consideration include: \na) counterparty risks (including country risks), \nb) market price risks, \nc) liquidity risks and \nd) operational risks. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 5 of 22  \nAT 2.3 Transactions \n \n1 In general, lending transactions within the meaning of this Circular include all transactions in \naccordance with section 19 (1) KWG (balance sheet assets and off-balance-sheet transac-\ntions entailing a counterparty risk). \n2 Lending decisions within the meaning of this Circ ular include all decisions on new loans, loan \nincreases, participating interests, the exceeding of limits, the determination of borrower-\nrelated limits, as well as counterparty and issuer limits, prolongations and changes to risk-relevant circumstances on which the lending decision was based (e.g. collateral, loan pur-pose). The issue as to whether the decision was taken by the institution only or together \nwith other institutions (syndicated lending) is immaterial. \n3 As a general rule, “trading business” covers all activities based on a \na) money market transaction, \nb) securities transaction, \nc) foreign exchange transaction, \nd) transaction in fungible receivables (e.g. trading in borrowers’ notes). \ne) transaction in commodities \nf) transaction in derivatives \nand which are concluded in the institution’s own name and for its own account. Securities \ntransactions also include transactions with registered bonds and securities lending, but not \nthe initial issue of securities. Trading transactions also include - regardless of the underlying \n- any form of repurchase agreement. \n4 Transactions in derivatives include forward transactions with prices which derive from an un-\nderlying asset, a reference price, a reference in terest rate, a reference index or an event de-\nfined in advance. \n \nAT 3 Overall responsibility of the management board \n \n1 Management board (section 1 (2) KWG) is responsible - irrespective of their internal respon-\nsibilities - for ensuring that the company has a proper business organisation and that this \norganisation is developed further. This responsibility encompasses all material aspects of risk \nmanagement and has to take into account outs ourced activities and processes. Management \nboard is only capable of meeting this responsibility if the risk management system allows them to assess the risks and take the necessary measures to limit them. \n \n AT 4 General requirements for risk management  \n \nAT 4.1 Risk-bearing capacity \n \n1 On the basis of the overall risk profile, the in stitution has to ensure that the material risks \nare covered by the risk taking potential at all times, taking into account any correlation be-\ntween risks where appropriate, and that the institution is therefore able to bear its material risks. \n2 An institution’s risk-bearing capacity has to be taken into account when determining strate-\ngies (AT 4.2) and adjusting these strategies. Appropriate processes for identifying, assess-ing, treating, monitoring and communicating risks (AT 4.3.2) have to be established in order to implement the strategies and guarantee the institution’s risk-bearing capacity. \n3 Institutions have to define all material risks which are not included in the assessment of their \nrisk-bearing capacity (e.g. liquidity risks). Institutions have to state clearly the reasons for \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 6 of 22 the non-inclusion of such risks. Institutions have to ensure that the processes for identifying, \nassessing, treating, monitoring and communicating risks give appropriate consideration to such risks. \n4 The individual institution is responsible for selecting the methods employed to determine its \nrisk-bearing capacity. The assumptions on wh ich the methods are based have to be ex-\nplained clearly. The responsible employees ha ve to examine the methods at least once a \nyear to assess their suitability. \n \nAT 4.2 Strategies \n \n1 The management board has to define a business strategy and a consistent risk strategy. The \nrisk strategy has to take into account the objectives and plans of the institution’s material \nbusiness activities as set forth in the business strategy, as well as the risks of material out-\nsourcings (AT 9 item 2). Responsibility for the determination of these strategies cannot be delegated. The management board is required to ensure the implementation of the strate-\ngies. The level of detail contained in the strate gies depends on the scope and complexity, as \nwell as the risk content of the planned business activities. \n2 The risk strategy has to contain the objectives of risk treatment with regard to the institu-\ntion’s material business activities. It may be divided into sub-strategies where appropriate \n(e.g. a strategy for counterparty risks). The level of detail of these sub-strategies may vary. \nAppropriate consideration has to be given to the limitation of risk concentrations when de-termining the risk strategy. \n3 The management board has to review the strategies at least once per year and adjust them \nas appropriate. The supervisory body of the instit ution has to be notified of all strategies and \ngiven an opportunity to discuss them. \n4 The content of the risk strategy as well as an y amendments thereto, together with the busi-\nness strategy where appropriate, have to be communicated in a suitable manner within the \ninstitution. \n \nAT 4.3 Internal control system \n \n1 Depending on the nature, scale, complexity and risk content of its business activities, each \ninstitutions has to  \na) set forth regulations regarding the organisational and operational structure and \nb) establish processes for identifying, assessing, treating, monitoring and communicating \nrisks. \n \nAT 4.3.1 Organisational and operational structure \n \n1 When determining the organisational and operational structure, the institution has to ensure \nthat incompatible activities are performed by different employees. \n2 Processes, as well as the related tasks, competencies, responsibilities, controls and commu-\nnication channels have to be clearly defined and attuned to one another. This also applies to \nthe linkage to material outsourcings. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 7 of 22  \nAT 4.3.2 Processes for identifying,  assessing, treating, monitoring \nand communicating risks \n \n1 The institution has to establish appropriate processes which ensure that material risks can be \na) identified, \nb) assessed, \nc) treated and \nd) monitored and communicated. \nThese processes should be included in an integrated risk-return management system (“Ge-\nsamtbanksteuerung”).  \n2 The processes for identifying, assessing, treati ng, monitoring and communicating risks have \nto ensure that material risks – including those arising from outsourced activities and proc-\nesses – can be identified at an early stage, captured completely and presented in an appro-\npriate manner. The processes should take an y correlations between the various types of \nrisk into account. \n3 Appropriate scenarios are to be employed on a regular basis to assess the risks used to de-\ntermine the institution’s risk-bearing capacity. \n4 The management board has to require submission of a report on the risk situation and the \nresult of the scenario assessments at appropriat e intervals. The risk report has to be writ-\nten clearly and concisely, and has to contain both a description and an assessment of the \nrisk situation. Suggested actions, e.g. to reduce  risk, are also to be included in the risk re-\nport where required. Details on risk reporting can be found in BTR 1 to BTR 4.  \n5 Information which is important from a risk point of view has to be communicated immedi-\nately to the management board, the responsible members of staff and, where appropriate, internal audit, so that appropriate measures and/or audits can be initiated at an early \nstage. \n6 The management board has to submit an appropriate written report on the institution’s risk \nsituation to the supervisory body on a quarterly basis. \n7 The processes for identifying, assessing, treati ng, monitoring and communicating risks have \nto be amended to reflect any changes in the overall situation as soon as possible.  \n \nAT 4.4 Internal audit \n \n1 Each institution must have a functioning internal audit in place. The functions of an internal \naudit may be carried out by a member of the management board if it would be dispropor-tionate with respect to the size of the institution to establish an internal audit. \n2 The internal audit as an instrument of the ma nagement board is under its direct control and \nhas to report to the management board. It can also be subject to the direct control of one executive in the management board, who should, if possible, be the chairperson. \n3 The internal audit has to examine and assess, in a manner which is risk-focused and inde-\npendent of individual processes, the effectiv eness and appropriateness of the “risk manage-\nment in general”, and the internal control system in particular, as well as the extent to which all activities and processes comply with the appropriate regulations regardless of whether \nthese are outsourced or not. This does not affect BT 2.1 item 3. \n4 In order to enable it to perform its duties, the internal audit has to be granted a full, unlim-\nited right to information. This right has to be ensured at all times. In this respect, the inter-\nnal audit has to be immediately provided with the necessary information, the required \ndocuments and an opportunity to review the institution’s activities, processes and IT sys-tems. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 8 of 22 5 The internal audit has to be informed of any management board directives and resolutions \nthat could be relevant to its activities. It has to be informed of any material changes to the risk management in a timely manner. \n6 With respect to its risk management at group level group internal audit shall supplement the \nactivities of the internal audit of subsidiaries. Group internal audit may also make use of the findings of the internal audit of the subsidiary companies. \n \nAT 5 Organisational guidelines \n \n1 The institution has to ensure that its business activities are conducted on the bases of organ-\nisational guidelines (e.g. manuals, work documentation or workflow procedures). The level of complexity of the organisational guidelines depends on the nature, scale, complexity and risk \ncontent of the business activities in question. \n2 The organisational guidelines have to be set down in writing and communicated to the staff \nmembers concerned in a suitable manner. Care has to be taken to ensure that the latest version of these guidelines is available to these staff members. The guidelines have to be \namended to reflect any changes in the institutions’ activities and processes as soon as possi-\nble. \n3 Most importantly, the organisational guidelines has to contain the following information: \na) rules regarding the organisational and operational structure, as well as the assignment \nof tasks, the decision-making hierarchy and the various responsibilities, \nb) rules on the processes for identifying, assessing, treating, monitoring and communicat-\ning risk, \nc) rules for the internal audit,  \nd) rules which ensure compliance with statutory provisions and other requirements (e.g. \ndataprotection, compliance) and \ne) rules for procedures for material outsourcings. \n4 The organisational guidelines have to enable the internal audit to conduct an audit. \n \nAT 6 Documentation  \n \n1 As a general rule, all business, control and monitoring records have to be drawn up system-\natically and in a manner which is clear to knowledgeable third parties and, subject to statu-\ntory regulations, retained for two years. Files have to be kept up to date and processes are to be in place to ensure that the contents are complete. \n2 Any material actions and decisions that are relevant for compliance with this Circular have to \nbe documented in a clear manner. This also includes decisions with regard to the use of sig-\nnificant opening clauses, for which grounds have to be stated, where appropriate. \n \nAT 7 Resources \n \nAT 7.1 Personnel \n \n1 The staffing of the institution has to be based, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, on \nthe institution’s internal operational needs, business activities and risk situation. This also applies to the assignment of temporary staff. \n2 The employees and their deputies have to have  the knowledge and experience required as \ndetermined by their duties, competencies and responsibilities. Suitable measures have to be taken to ensure that the employees have the appropriate qualifications. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 9 of 22 3 Employee absence, or resignation from the institution, should not result in any long-term \nimpairment of operations.  \n4 The remuneration and incentive systems must not contradict the aims set forth in the \nstrategies. \n \nAT 7.2 Technical facilitie s and related processes \n \n1 The scope and quality of the institution’s technical facilities and related processes have to be \nbased, in particular, on the institution’s operational needs, business activities and risk situa-\ntion. \n2 The IT systems (hardware and software components) and the related IT processes have to \nensure data integrity, availability, authenticity  and confidentiality. In order to ensure this, \nthe IT systems and the related IT processes have to be based on established standards as a \ngeneral principle. The suitability of these systems and processes has to be assessed on a regular basis by the employees responsible for the technical and professional aspects of the \nrelevant processes and systems. \n3 The IT systems have to be tested before they are used for the first time and after any mate-\nrial changes have been made. They have to th en be approved by both the staff responsible \nfor the relevant processes and the staff responsible for the systems. As a general rule, the \nproduction and testing environments has to be kept separate. \n4 Enhancements and changes to technical specific ations (e.g. the adjustment of parameters) \nhave to involve both the staff responsible for the relevant processes and the staff responsi-\nble for the systems. Technical approval need not be user-specific. \n \nAT 7.3 Contingency plan \n \n1 Provisions are to be made for emergencies relating to time-critical activities and processes \n(contingency plan). The measures set forth in the contingency plan have to aim at reducing the scale of any possible impact. The effectiveness and suitability of the plan have to be as-\nsessed on a regular basis by means of contingency testing. The results of the contingency \ntests have to be communicated to the responsible members of staff. If time-critical activities and processes are outsourced, the outsourcing in stitution and the external service provider \nare to have contingency plans that are coordinated with each other. \n2 The contingency plan has to include business continuity and recovery plans. The business \ncontinuity plans have to ensure that alternat ive solutions are available in the event of an \nemergency as soon as possible. The recovery pl ans have to ensure the restoration of normal \noperations within an appropriate period of ti me. The contingency plans have to provide the \ncommunication channels to be used in the event of an emergency and have to be provided to the affected employees. \n \nAT 8 Activities in new products or on new markets \n \n1 A plan has to be drawn up prior to commencing business activities that relate to new prod-\nucts or markets (including new distribution channels). This plan is to be based on the result of the risk content analysis performed for these new business activities. It has to describe \nthe main consequences of the new activities on risk management.  \n2 The decision as to whether or not activities involve a new product or market have to be \nmade in conjunction with an area independent of front office and trading (BTO 1 item 2). \n3 As far as trading activities are concerned, a test phase has to, as a general rule, be intro-\nduced before continuous trading in the new product or on the new market commences. Dur-ing the test phase, trading has to be limited to a manageable scale. Care has to be taken to \nensure that continuous trading begins only once the test phase has been completed success-\nfully and appropriate processes for identifying, assessing, treating, monitoring and commu-nicating risks are in place. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 10 of 22 4 The organisational units which will be involved in the operations of the new business at a \nlater stage have to participate in the drafting of  the plan and in the test phase; the internal \naudit has to be involved in line with its duties.  \n5 The plan and the commencement of ongoing busine ss activities have to be approved by the \nprofessional responsible management board member, in cooperation with the management board member responsible for monitoring the ac tivities in question. These approval proc-\nesses can be delegated, provided that clear guidelines are in place and that the management \nboard is informed of the decisions as soon as possible. \n6 If the organisational units to be involved in the operation of the new business at a later \nstage believe that the activities in a new product or on a new market can be managed ap-\npropriately, AT 8 need not be applied. \n \nAT 9 Outsourcing \n \n1 Outsourcing is the assignment of another company to carry out activities or processes re-\nlated to the execution of banking transactions, financial services or other typical services \nthat would otherwise be performed by the institution itself. \n2 On the basis of a risk analysis the institution shall determine on its own responsibility which \noutsourcings of activities and processes are material with regard to risks (material outsourc-\nings). The respective operational units are to be involved in the preparation of the risk \nanalysis. The internal audit shall also be involved within the scope of its functions. The risk analysis has to be revised when material changes occur in the risk situation. \n3 Outsourcings which are non-material with regard to risk have to comply with the general re-\nquirements on proper organisation pursuant to section 25a (1) KWG. \n4 As a general rule, all activities and processes may be outsourced when this does not impair \nproper business organisation pursuant to section 25a (1) KWG. Outsourcing must not lead to \nthe delegation of management board responsibility to the insourcing company. Management \nboard functions must not be outsourced. Special requirements for outsourcing measures may also arise from specific statutory regulations, for example those for Building Societies \n(Bausparkassen) with respect to the risk control/management of the home savings collective \n(Kollektivsteuerung). \n5 If the institution intends to terminate a material outsourcing contract it shall take measures \nto ensure continuitity and quality of the outsou rced activities and processes after termination \nof the respective contracts. \n6 The following terms shall be agreed in the outsourcing contract for material outsourcings: \na) specification and if necessary description of service to be performed by the insourcing \ncompany,  \nb) stipulation of information and audit rights of the internal audit and external audits,  \nc) ensuring BaFin’s information and examin ing rights and control capabilitiy, \nd) rights to give directives if necessary,  \ne) regulations that ensure compliance with data protection provisions, \nf) appropriate periods of notice, \ng) regulations on the possibility and the moda lities of sub-outsourcing that guarantee \nthat the institutions continue to comply with the banking supervisory requirements, \nh) the commitment of the insourcing firm to inform the institution of any developments \nthat may impair the proper performance of the outsourced activities and processes. \n7 The institution shall manage the risks associated with material outsourcings in an appropri-\nate manner and monitor the execution of the outsourced activities and processes in a proper manner. This also includes a regular evaluation of the service of the insourcing firm on the \nbasis of specific criteria. The institution must assign clear responsibilities for management \nand monitoring. \n8 If internal audit is to be outsourced complete ly the management board shall appoint an audit \nofficer who has to ensure that internal audit is functioning properly. The requirements of AT \n4.4 and BT 2 are to be taken into account accordingly. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 11 of 22 9 The requirements on the outsourcing of activiti es and processes must also be complied with \nwhen outsourced activities and processes are sub-outsourced. \n \nBT 1 Special requirements for the internal control sys-\ntem \n \n1 This module sets out the special requirements for the internal control system. These re-\nquirements relate primarily to the organisational and operational structure in the lending and \ntrading business (BTO) and the processes for identifying, assessing, treating, monitoring and \ncommunicating risks for counterparty risks, market  price risks, liquidity risks and operational \nrisks (BTR). \n \nBTO Requirements for the organisational and operational \nstructure  \n \n1 The purpose of this module is to set forth the requirements that apply to the organisational \nand operational structure in the lending and trading business. The BTO requirements can be \napplied in a simplified manner depending on the size of the institution, its business focus and its risk situation. \n2 This Circular distinguishes between the following areas: \na) the area which initiates lending transactions and has a vote in the lending decisions \n(“front office”),  \nb) the area which has an additional vote on lending decisions (“back office”) and \nc) “trading”. \n \nFurthermore, a distinction is also ma de between the following functions: \nd) those functions which serve to monitor and communicate risks (“risk control function”) \nand \ne) those functions which serve to settle and control trading transactions (“settlement and \ncontrol function”). \n3 As a general rule, care has to be taken to ensure that the structure of the front office and \ntrading areas are kept separate, up to and including the management board level, from those areas or functions set forth in item 2 b), d) and e), as well as in BTO 1.1 item 7, BTO \n1.2 item 1, BTO 1.2.4 item 1, BTO 1.2.5 item 1 and BTO 1.4 item 2.  \n4 Market price risk control functions have to be separated, up to and including the manage-\nment board level, from those areas which are responsible for positions.  \n5 The segregation of functions has also to be obse rved at deputy level. In principle, the desig-\nnated deputy can also be a suitable member  of staff below management board level. \n6 The involvement of the management board member  responsible for the risk control functions \nin a committee entrusted by management board with risk management duties does not con-\nflict with the principle of the segregation of functions. \n7 The section responsible for accounting (accounting department), in particular the preparation \nof the account allocation rules and development of the system of accounts, has to be inde-\npendent of the front offi ce and trading areas. \n8 As a general rule, material legal risks are to be assessed by asection which is independent of \nthe front office and trading areas (e.g. the legal department). \n9 In the case of IT-based processing, the segreg ation of functions is to be ensured by means \nof corresponding procedures and precautions. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 12 of 22  \nBTO 1 Lending business \n \n1 This module sets out the requirements that apply to the organisational and operational \nstructure, the procedures for the early detectio n of risks and the procedures for the classifi-\ncation of risks in the lending business. As far as trading transactions and participating inter-\nests are concerned, the implementation of indi vidual requirements set forth in this module \nmay be waived provided that their implementati on is not deemed to be appropriate in view \nof the specific features of these types of bu siness (e.g. the requirement to monitor the loan \npurpose set forth in BTO 1.2.2 item 1). \n \nBTO 1.1 Segregation of functions and voting \n \n1 The basic principle that applies to the structur e of processes in lending business is the clear \nstructural separation of the front office and back office up to and including the management board level. In the case of small institutions, exceptions may be made under certain circum-\nstances with regard to the segregation of functions.  \n2 Depending on the nature, scale, complexity and risk content of the exposure in question, a \nlending decision requires two consenting votes by both the front and back office. This is \nwithout prejudice to any further-reaching de cision-making rules (e.g. KWG, memorandum \nand articles of association). If these decisions are made by a single committee, the majority structure within that committee has to be defined in such a way that the back office cannot \nbe outvoted. \n3 In the case of trading transactions, counterparty  and issuer limits are to be set by means of \na back office vote.  \n4 In the case of lending decisions which are deemed immaterial from a risk point of view, the \ninstitution may decide that only one vote is necessary (“non-risk relevant lending transac-\ntions”). The process can also be simplified in the case of lending transactions initiated by \nthird parties. In this respect, the structural se paration between front office and back office is \nonly relevant to lending transactions where the risk involved makes two votes necessary. If \na second vote is not necessary, care has to be taken to ensure the proper implementation of the requirements set forth in BTO 1.2. \n5 Each management board member may, within th e limits of the individual decision-making \npower, take lending decisions independently and also maintain customer contact; this does not affect the structural separation between the front office and the back office. In addition, two votes are required where risk aspects render this necessary. In the event that decisions \nmade within the framework of an individual’s  decision-making power deviate from the votes \nor if such decisions are made by the manage ment board member responsible for the back \noffice, they have to be highlighted in the risk report (BTR 1 item 7). \n6 The institution has to define a clear and consistent decision-making hierarchy for decisions in \nlending business. If the votes are split, clear decision-making rules have to be defined in this hierarchy. In such cases, the loan has to be ei ther rejected or passed on to the next hierar-\nchy level for a decision (escalation procedure). \n7 The review of certain types of collateral – to be determined under risk aspects – is to be \nconducted outside the front office. This also applies to suggestions regarding risk provision-ing for significant exposures. The organisational integration of all other processes or sub-\nprocesses listed in BTO 1.2 is at the institutions' discretion (such as loan processing or sub-\nprocesses of loan processing), unless this Circular states otherwise. \n \nBTO 1.2 Requirements for lending business processes \n \n1 The institution has to set up loan processing procedures (the granting and further processing \nof the loan), the monitoring of loan processing, intensified loan management, the processing \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 13 of 22 of problem loans and risk provisioning. Respon sibility for the development and quality of \nthese processes has to lie outside of the front office. \n2 The institution has to formulate processing guidelines for lending business processes, which \nare to be broken down (e.g. by loan type) where appropriate. It has to set up also proce-\ndures for the monitoring, administration and realisation of pledged collateral. \n3 All aspects material to the counterparty risk of a lending exposure have to be identified and \nassessed, with the intensity of these activities  depending on the risk content of the expo-\nsures. Recourse may also be made to external sources when assessing counterparty risk. \nSector and, where appropriate, country risks have to be given the appropriate consideration. Critical issues concerning an exposure are to be highlighted and, where applicable, consid-\nered under various scenarios.  \n4 With respect to property/project financing, the loan processing procedure has to ensure that \nnot only the economic aspects, but also those aspects regarding the technical feasibility and \ndevelopment, as well as the legal risks associated with the property/project, are included in \nthe assessment. Recourse may also be made to the expertise of an appropriate organisa-tional unit independent of the borrower. When ever external sources are consulted for these \npurposes, their qualification has to be assessed in advance. \n5 Depending on the risk content of the loans, the risks related to an exposure are to be evalu-\nated using a risk classification procedure, either as part of the lending decision or in the case \nof regular or ad hoc assessments. The risk classification is to be reviewed annually. \n6 There should be a verifiable link between the cla ssification in the risk classification procedure \nand the terms and conditions of the loan. \n7 The institution has to establish a procedure that conforms to the decision-making hierarchy, \nfor dealing with the exceeding of limits. To the extent acceptable in terms of the risk, the re-\nquirements set forth in BTO 1.1. and BTO 1.2 may be applied in a simplified fashion to the exceeding of limits and prolongations on the basis of clear rules. \n8 A procedure has to be set up to monitor the timely submission of the necessary lending \ndocuments and ensure timely evaluation. A dunning procedure is to be implemented for \noverdue documents. \n9 The institution has to use standardised lending documents, to the extent that this is possible \nand appropriate with respect to the type of lending business in question, with the structure \nof the credit documents depending on the nature, scale, complexity and risk content of the business. \n10 Contractual agreements relating to lending business have to be concluded on the basis of le-\ngally validated documentation.  \n11 Legally validated standard texts, which have to be updated on an ongoing basis, have to be \nused for individual loan agreements. Where a de viation from the standard texts is necessary \nfor a given exposure (such as in the case of customised agreements), an examination has to \nbe conducted by a section that is independent of the front office prior to signing the agree-\nment, to the extent that this is deemed  necessary from a risk point of view. \n \nBTO 1.2.1 Granting of loans \n1 The process of granting loans encompasses all necessary workflows up to the loan payout. \nAll factors which are material to risk assessment have to be analysed and assessed, taking \nparticular account of the debt-servicing abil ity of the borrower or the property/project, \nwhereby the intensity of the assessment depends on the risk content of the exposure (e.g. \ncredit assessment, risk classification or an assessment based on a simplified procedure). \n2 As a general rule, the value and legal validity of collateral has to be assessed prior to the \ngranting of the loan. Existing collateral values may be used if there are no indications of changes in value. \n3 If the value of the collateral is dependent to a substantial degree on the financial situation of \na third party (e.g. guarantee), the counterparty risk of the third party has to be reviewed as \nappropriate. \n4 The institution has to set forth the types of collateral it is willing to accept and the method of \ncalculating the value of collateral.  \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 14 of 22 BTO 1.2.2 Further processing of loans \n1 Whether or not the borrower is complying with the terms of the contract has to be monitored \nin the further processing of loans. In the case of special-purpose loans, the institution has to \nmonitor whether or not the funds made available are being used as agreed (monitoring of \nthe loan purpose). \n2 Counterparty risk is to be assessed annually, whereby the intensity of ongoing assessments \ndepends on the risk content of the exposure (e .g. credit assessment, risk classification as \npart of the risk classification procedure, or assessment based on a simplified procedure). \n3 The value and legal validity of collateral has to be assessed at suitable intervals within the \nframework of further loan processing, depending on  the type of collateral and if higher than \na threshold set by the institution in accordance with the risk involved.  \n4 Ad hoc reviews of exposures, including collateral, have to be conductedimmediately, at least \nwhenever the institution obtains knowledge, from either internal or external sources, which \nwould indicate a substantial negative change in the risk assessment of the exposures or the \ncollateral. Such information has to be forwarded to all of the organisational units involved \nimmediately. \n \nBTO 1.2.3 Monitoring of loan processing \n1 Process-related controls have to be established for loan processing to ensure compliance \nwith the organisational guidelines. Controls may also be conducted via the standard “four-eyes” principle. \n2 The monitoring procedure has to focus, in particular, on whether or not the loan approval \nwas in line with the defined decision-making hierarchy and whether or not the prerequisites \nor requirements of the loan agreement were met prior to the granting of the loan. \n \nBTO 1.2.4 Intensified loan management \n1 The institution has to set forth criteria to determine when an exposure requires special ob-\nservation (intensified loan management). Responsibility for the development and quality, as well as the regular review of these criteria has to lie outside of the front office. \n2 Exposures under intensified loan management are to be reviewed at regularly scheduled in-\ntervals, in order to determine what sort of fu rther handling they require (further intensified \nloan management, return to normal management , transfer to winding up or restructuring). \n \nBTO 1.2.5 Treatment of problem loans \n1 The institution has to forth criteria governing the transfer of an exposure to the staff or ar-\neas specialising in restructuring and winding up, and/or their involvement. Responsibility for \nthe development and quality, as well as the regular review of these criteria has to lie outside \nof the front office. The lead responsibility for the restructuring or winding-up process and the monitoring thereof need not be exercised by the front office. \n2 If the criteria have been met, an assessment is  to be conducted as to the feasibility and/or \ndesirability of a restructuring with respect to the borrower. \n3 If the institution decides to support a restructur ing, it has to require submission of a restruc-\nturing plan. The implementation of the restru cturing plan and the effects of the measures \nare to be monitored by the institution. \n4 In the case of significant exposures, the re sponsible management board members have to \nbe informed of the status of the restructuring process on a regular basis. If necessary, re-\ncourse can be taken to outside specialists with relevant expertise for the restructuring proc-\ness. \n5 In the event that an exposure is to be wound up, a winding-up plan needs to be developed. \nEmployees (or external specialists where appropriate) with relevant expertise are to be in-\nvolved in the collateral realisation process. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 15 of 22 BTO 1.2.6 Risk provisioning \n1 The institution has to set forth criteria which are to form the basis for value allowances, \nwrite-downs and loan loss provisions (including country risk provisioning), taking due ac-count of the accounting standards in use (e.g. an internal valuation procedure for loans). \n2 The calculations of necessary risk provisioning are to be kept up to date. In the event that \nsubstantial risk provisioning is required, the management board has to be notified immedi-ately. \n \nBTO 1.3 Procedure for the early detection of risks \n \n1 The procedure for the early detection of risks is intended primarily to identify, in a timely \nmanner, borrowers whose loans are beginning to show signs of increased risk. With such a system in hand, the institution shall be able to initiate countermeasures at the earliest pos-\nsible stage (e.g. intensified loan management). \n2 To this end, the institution has to develop indicators for the early identification of risks based \non quantitative and qualitative risk features. \n3 The institution is permitted to exempt certain types of lending business to be defined under \nrisk aspects or lending transactions below certain thresholds from the application of the pro-cedure for the early detection of risks. The func tion of early detection of risks may also be \nperformed by a risk classification procedure, provided that this procedure adequately allows \nearly detection of risks. \n \nBTO 1.4 Risk classi fication procedure \n \n1 Clear risk classification procedures are to set up at every institution for the initial, regular or \nad hoc assessment of counterparty risk and, as  appropriate, property/project risk. Criteria \nhave to be defined to ensure that risks are clearly assigned to a risk class for the purpose of \ntheir assessment. \n2 Responsibility for the development, quality and monitoring of the use of risk classification \nprocedures must not lie with the front office. \n3 Key indicators for determining counterparty risk in the risk classification procedure have to \ninclude not only quantitative criteria but, wherever possible, also qualitative criteria. In par-\nticular, account has to be taken of the borrower’s ability to generate income in the future in order to repay the loan. \n4 The classification procedures are to be adeq uately incorporated into the lending business \nprocesses and, where appropriate, into the decision-making hierarchy.  \n \nBTO 2 Trading business \n \n1 The main purpose of this module is to set forth the requirements that apply to the organisa-\ntional and operational structure in the trading business. \n \nBTO 2.1 Segregation of functions \n \n1 The basic principle that applies to processes in the trading business is the clear structural \nseparation between the trading area and the “risk control function” and “settlement and con-\ntrol function” up to and including the management board level. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 16 of 22 2 An institution may refrain from the segregation of functions including the management board \nlevel if the whole of trading activities focus on  trading transactions deemed immaterial from \na risk point of view (\"non-risk-relevant trading activities\"). \n \nBTO 2.2 Requirements for tr ading business processes \n \nBTO 2.2.1 Trading \n1 When a trade is transacted, the terms and conditions, including any ancillary agreements, \nhave to be agreed in full. \n2 As a general rule, transactions which are not in-line with market conditions are not permit-\nted. Exceptions may be made in individual cases if \na) they are made at the client’s request, can be justified and the deviation from market \nconditions is clearly visible from the documentation, \nb) they are made on the basis of internal rules governing the types of transaction, the cli-\nent group, the scale and the structure of these transactions, \nc) the deviation from market conditions is disclosed to the client in the trade confirmation \nand \nd) the management has been informed in the case of material transactions. \n3 Trading outside the business premises is only admissible within the scope of internal rules; \ntheses rules have to specify, in particular, the authorised individuals, scope and recording. \nThe counterparty has to make an immediate telex confirmation for such trades. These trades \nare to be reported immediately by the trader to his own institution in a suitable form, they are to be marked and brought to the notice of the responsible management board member \nor an organisational unit authorised by that member. \n4 Audio recordings should be made of traders' conversations relating to transactions, and \nthese recordings are to be retained for at least three months. \n5 Immediately after their conclusion, trades must be recorded together with all of the relevant \ntransaction data, taken into account when determining the respective position (updating of positions) and passed on to the settlement func tion together with all documentation. The \ntransaction data may also be transferred automatically by a settlement system. \n6 Where data is recorded directly in an IT system, care has to be taken to ensure that a trader \ncan enter transactions solely under his own trader  ID. The recording date and time as well as \nthe transaction’s serial number are to be entered automatically by the system and must be \nimpossible for the trader to alter. \n7 Trades concluded after the cut-off time for settlement (late trades) are to be marked as such \nand included in that day's positions (including subsequent settlement) if they result in sub-\nstantial changes. The transaction data and docume ntation relating to late trades have to be \npassed immediately to an area which is independent of trading.  \n8 Prior to the conclusion of agreements in connection with trading activities, especially in the \ncase of master agreements, netting agreements and collateral agreements, assessments are \nto be performed by a section which is independent of trading, to determine whether and, if \nso, to what extent they are legally enforceable.  \n9 With regard to money transfers employees belonging to the trading area in organisational \nterms may only have joint signature authority with employees from an areawhich is inde-\npendent of trading. \n \nBTO 2.2.2 Settlement and control \n1 Processing involves the issuing of trade confir mations or contract notes on the basis of the \ntransaction data received from trading and performing subsequent settlement tasks. \n2 As a matter of principle, every trade is to be confirmed immediately in writing or in equiva-\nlent form. The confirmation has to contain the required transaction data. If the trade is \ntransacted via a broker, the broker is to be named. Assessments are to be performed to en-\nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 17 of 22 sure that the corresponding counter-confirmatio ns are received immediately, whereby care \nhas to be taken to ensure that the incoming counter-confirmations are passed directly to the \nsettlement function in the first instance and are not addressed to trading. Missing or in-\ncomplete counter-confirmations have to be repo rted to the counterparty immediately, unless \nall parts of the trade in question have been executed correctly.  \n3 The institution may refrain from confirmation in the case of trades cleared via a settlement \nsystem that ensures the automatic reconciliation of the relevant transaction data (“match-\ning”) and executes trades only where the data matches. In the event that there is no auto-\nmatic matching of the relevant transaction data, the institution may refrain from confirma-tion if the settlement system allows both counter parties to access the transaction data at all \ntimes and these are kept monitored. \n4 Transactions are to be subject to ongoing monitoring. In particular, assessments have to be \nmade to ascertain whether \na) the transaction documents are complete and have been submittedas soon as possible, \nb) the data supplied by traders is correct an d complete and - where available - matches \nthe data in the brokers' confirmations, print-outs from trading systems or other rele-vant sources, \nc) the transactions fall within the defined limits with regard to their type and scope, \nd) the terms agreed are in line with market conditions, and \ne) any deviations from predefined standards (e.g. master data, delivery instructions \nmethods of payment) have been agreed. \nChanges and cancellations related to transaction data or booking have to be assessed inde-\npendent of the trading section. \n5 Appropriate procedures, broken down by trade type as appropriate, must be set up to allow \nassessments to be performed on the extent to which transactions comply with market condi-tions.  The management board member responsible for these assessments has to be in-\nformed immediately if, in deviation from BTO 2.2.1 item 2, the terms and conditions of exe-\ncuted trades do no comply with market conditions. \n6 Any discrepancies identified during settlement and control has to be remedied immediately \nby an area independent of trading. \n7 The positions established in the trading area are to be matched with the positions in the \ndownstream processes and functions (e.g. settlement, accounting) on a regular basis. \n \nBTO 2.2.3 Positions to be covere d by the risk control function \n1 Trades, including ancillary agreements which result in positions, have to be covered by the \nrisk control function immediately. \n \nBTR Requirements for processes for identifying, assess-\ning, treating, monitoring and communicating risks \n \n1 This module contains special requirements for the structure of processes for identifying, as-\nsessing, treating, monitoring and communicating risks (AT 4.3.2) with regard to \na) counterparty risks (BTR 1),  \nb) market price risks (BTR 2),  \nc) liquidity risks (BTR 3) and  \nd) operational risks (BTR 4). \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 18 of 22  \nBTR 1 Counterparty risks \n \n1 The institution has to introduce appropriate measures to ensure that counterparty risks can \nbe limited, taking into account its risk-bearing capacity. \n2 No lending transaction may be entered into without a borrower-related limit (borrower limits, \nborrower unit limits), i.e. without a lending decision. \n3 As a general rule, trades may only be executed with contractual partners for which counter-\nparty limits apply. All transactions concluded with a particular counterparty are to be \ncounted towards that counterparty's individual limit. Replacement risks und settlement risks \nhave to be taken into account when determining the extent to which the counterparty limits have been utilised. The individuals responsible for the positions in question have to be in-\nformed of the limits that apply to them and their current utilisation level as soon as possible. \n4 Furthermore, issuer limits generally have to be set up for trades also. If limits do not exist \nfor particular issuers in trading, issuer limits for trading purposes may be defined at short notice based on clear rules, without the need to perform the full loan processing procedure-\ndefined in the relevant organisational guidelines according to risk aspects. The relevant loan \nprocessing procedure has to be initiated within three months. \n5 Transactions are to be counted towards the borrower-related limits immediately. Compliance \nwith the limits has to be monitored. Records are to be kept of any instances in which limits \nare exceeded, as well as of any measures ta ken as a result. The exceeding of counterparty \nand issuer limits that exceed a level determined from a risk point of view has to be reported \nto the responsible management board members on a daily basis. \n6 Suitable measures have to be taken to ensure that significant overall business risks (sector-\nrelated risks, distribution of exposures by size  category and risk class, and, where appropri-\nate, country risks and other concentration risks) can be treated and monitored. \n7 A risk report, which has to include the key structural characteristics of the lending business, \nhas to be drawn up at regular intervals, but at least on a quarterly basis, and provided to the management board. \nThe risk report has to contain the following information: \na) the performance of the lending portfolio, e.g.  by sector, country, risk class and size or \ncollateral category, \nb) the extent of limits granted and extern al lines; moreover, large exposures and other \nnoteworthy exposures (e.g. material problem loans) have to be listed and commented on, \nc) where appropriate, a separate analysis of country risks, \nd) any instances where limits were exceeded to a substantial degree (including reasons), \ne) the scale and development of new business, f) the development of the institution’s risk provisioning, \ng) any major lending decisions made which deviate from the strategies and  \nh) lending decisions taken by management board members acting within their individual \ndecision-making power which differ from th e votes or were taken by a management \nboard member responsible for the back office. \n \nBTR 2 Market price risks \n \nBTR 2.1 General requirements \n \n1 A limit system has to be set up on the basis of the institution’s risk-bearing capacity in order \nto limit market price risks. \n2 No transaction that incurs market price risks may be entered into in the absence of a market \nprice risk limit. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 19 of 22 3 The procedures used to assess market price risks have to be reviewed on a regular basis. \n4 The results calculated by the accounting department and the risk control function have tobe \nsubjected to regular plausibility checks. \n5 A risk report, which has to include details of the market price risks incurred by the institu-\ntion, has to be drawn up at regular intervals, but at least on a quarterly basis, and provided \nto the management board. The report has to contain the following information: \na) an overview of the risk development and pe rformance of positions that incur market \nprice risks, \nb) any instances in which the limits ha ve been substantially exceeded, and \nc) changes to key assumptions or parameters which form the basis of the market price \nrisk assessment procedures. \n \nBTR 2.2 Market price risks in the trading book \n \n1 The institution has to ensure that trading book transactions which incur market price risks \nare counted immediately towards the corresponding limits and that the individual responsible for a position is informed as soon as possible of the limits relevant to him and of their cur-\nrent level of utilisation. Suitable measures have to be introduced in the event that these lim-\nits are exceeded; an escalation procedure has to be initiated as appropriate. \n2 The trading book positions that incur market price risks have to be valuated on a daily basis.  \n3 Trading book results have to be calculated on a daily basis. The existing risk positions have \nto be consolidated into overall risk positions at  least once a day at the close of trading. In \nprinciple, the overall risk positions, results and limit utilisation levels have to be reported to the management board member responsible for risk control function as soon as possible on \nthe next business day. This report has to be agreed with the trading areas. \n4 Risk figures derived from risk simulation models have to be continuously compared with ac-\ntual trends. \n \nBTR 2.3 Market price risks in the banking book (including interest \nrate risks) \n \n1 The banking book positions that incur market price risks have to be valued on a quarterly \nbasis at the very least.  \n2 Furthermore, the banking book results have to be calculated on at least a quarterly basis. \n3 Suitable measures have to be taken to ensure that situations in which limits are exceeded \ndue to interim changes in risk positions can be avoided. \n4 Depending on the nature, scale, complexity and risk content of the positions in the banking \nbook, valuation, calculation and communication of risks may also be necessary on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.  \n5 The procedure used to assess interest rate risks in the banking book have to cover the key \ncharacteristics of interest rate risk. \n6 The determination of interest rate risks can be based either on the effects of interest rate \nchanges on accounting P&L of the institution or on the market or present value of the posi-\ntions in question. In determining the impact on accounting P&L, possible developments after \nthe balance sheet date have to be taken into account as appropriate.  \n7 Appropriate assumptions have to be established with regard to the consideration of positions \nwith indeterminate capital tie-up or interest terms. \n8 Institutions which incur material interest rate risks in various currencies have to assess the \ninterest rate risks in each currency. \n \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 20 of 22 BTR 3 Liquidity risks \n \n1 The institution has to ensure that it can meet its payment obligations at all times. At the \nsame time, it has to guarantee a sufficient level of diversification, primarily with regard to its \nasset and capital structure. \n2 The institution has to prepare a liquidity overview covering an appropriate period of time, \nwhich has to compare the institution’s expected inflows with its expected outflows of funds. \nIt has to specify the assumptions on which the expected in- and outflows are based. Appro-\npriate scenario assessments have to be performed on a regular basis when preparing the li-quidity overview. \n3 Assessments have to be performed on an ongoing basis to determine the extent to which the \ninstitution is in a position to cover any liquidity requirement which may arise. These assess-ments have to focus, in particular, on the liquidity of the institution’s assets. \n4 The institution has to set forth which measures are to be taken in the event of a liquidity \nsqueeze. This involves specifying the sources of liquidity available, taking into account any liquidation shortfalls. The institution has to determine also the communication channels to be used in the event of a liquidity squeeze. \n5 A report on the institution’s liquidity situation has to be submitted to the management board \non a regular basis. \n \nBTR 4 Operational risks \n \n1 The institution has to introduce appropriate measures to account for operational risks. \n2 Care has to be taken to ensure that material operational risks are identified and assessed at \nleast once a year. \n3 Major losses are to be analysed immediately with regard to their causes. \n4 A report on major losses and material operational risks has to be provided to the manage-\nment board at least once a year. This report has to include the type of loss or risk, the \ncauses, the scope of the loss or risk and, where appropriate, any countermeasures which \nhave been introduced. \n5 The report is to be used as the basis for decisions as to whether measures have to be taken \nto remedy the causes, and, if so, which measures, or which risk management measures \n(e.g. insurance policies, alternative procedures, reorientation of business activities, catastro-\nphe protection measures). The implementation of these measures has to be monitored. \n \nBT 2 Special requirements for the internal audit  \n \nBT 2.1 Duties of the internal audit  \n \n1 As a general rule, the audit activities of the internal audit have to cover all of a institution’s \nactivities and processes based on a risk-oriented approach. \n2 The internal audit should be involved in key projects, although it has to preserve its inde-\npendence and avoid conflicts of interest. \n3 In the case of material outsourcings to another company the internal audit of the institution \nmay not carry out own audit activities provided that the auditing work carried out within the \ninsourcing company meets the requirements of AT 4.4 and BT 2. The internal audit of the \noutsourcing institution shall satisfy itself at regular intervals that these prerequisites are ful-\nfilled. The audit findings concerning the institution are to be passed on to the internal audit \nof the outsourcing institution. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 21 of 22  \nBT 2.2 General principles for the internal audit  \n \n1 The internal audit department has to perform its duties in an autonomous and independent \nfashion. In particular, it has to ensure that it is not subject to any instructions with regard to \nits reporting and evaluation activities. The management’s right to order additional audits does not conflict with the autonomy and inde pendence of the internal audit department.  \n2 As a general rule, members of staff employed in the internal audit may not be entrusted with \ntasks which are not related to auditing. They may not, under any circumstances, perform tasks which are not consistent with auditing activities. Provided that the internal audit de-partment maintains its independence, it may provide advisory support to management or \nother organisational units of the institution within the realm of its duties. \n3 As a general rule, members of staff employed in other organisational units of the institution \nmay not be entrusted with internal audit tasks. This does not, however, rule out justified \nsituations in which other employees can, due to their particular expertise, conduct activities \nfor the internal audit on a temporary basis. \n \nBT 2.3 Planning and conducting of the audit \n \n1 The activities of the internal audit have to be based on a comprehensive audit plan which \nhas to be updated on a yearly basis. Audit plan ning has to be risk-oriented. The activities \nand processes of the institution, even if thes e are outsourced, have to be audited at appro-\npriate intervals, as a general rule within three years. Auditing has to be performed annually \nif particular risks exist. \n2 Audit planning, audit methods and quality are to be reviewed and developed further on an \nongoing basis. \n3 It has to be ensured that any special audits requ ired at short notice, e.g. due to deficiencies \nwhich have arisen or certain informational requirements, can be performed at any time. \n4 Audit planning, as well as any major adjustments to it, has to be approved by the manage-\nment board.  \n \nBT 2.4 Reporting obligation \n1 Internal audit has to prepare a written report on each audit as soon as possible and, as a \ngeneral rule, submit this report to the responsible management board members. In particu-lar, the report has to include a description of  the subject of the audit and the findings, in-\ncluding any planned measures where appropriate. Any major findings have to be highlighted. \nThe results of the audit also have to be assesse d. In the event of severe findings, the report \nhas to be submitted to the management board immediately. \n2 The audits are to be documented by working documents. These must show the work carried \nout, the findings, the conclusions and must be  drawn in a manner that is transparent for \ncompetent third parties. \n3 If a consensus cannot be reached between the au dited organisational unit and internal audit \nwith regard to the implementation of measures necessary for the remedy of findings, the \naudited organisational unit has to make an official statement. \n4 Internal audit has to prepare an overall report of  all of the audits performed in the course of \nthe financial year as soon as possible and present this report to the management board as \nsoon as possible. The overall report has to provide information on major findings and the \nremedy measures taken. It has to state whether or not and to what extent the audit plan has been adhered to. \n5 The management board has to be informed immedi ately in the event that the audit identifies \nsevere findings against management board me mbers. The management  board then immedi-\nately has to inform the chairperson of the su pervisory body and the supervisory authorities \n(BaFin, Deutsche Bundesbank). If the management  board fails to meet its reporting obliga-\ntion or if it fails to implement appropriate measures, internal audit has to inform the chair-person of the supervisory body. \nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) \nMinimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) – Page 22 of 22 6 The management board has to provide the superv isory body with a concise report on severe \nfindings and on the major findings which have not yet been remedied at least once a year. Severe findings, the measures resolved to remedy them and the implementation of these \nmeasures have to be highlighted in this report. The management board has to inform the \nsupervisory body of particularly  severe findings immediately. \n7 Audit reports and working documents are to be kept for six years. \n \nBT 2.5 Reaction to findings  \n1 The internal audit has to perform appropriate assessments to ensure that any findings iden-\ntified in the course of the audit are remedied within the required period. Where appropriate, \nit has to perform a follow-up audit. \n2 If the major findings are not remedied within an appropriate period, the head of internal au-\ndit at first has to inform the responsible member  of the management board in writing. If the \nfindings remain unresolved, the management board has to be informed of these findings in \nwriting in the next overall report at the latest. \n \n"

      "ANSWER:\n\nBaFin's ESG risk management requirements emphasize that institutions must systematically identify, measure, and manage environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks. This is essential due to the forward-looking nature of ESG risks and their potential impacts over various time horizons. Institutions are expected to integrate ESG considerations into their business models and strategies, ensuring they account for short, medium, and long-term challenges. \n\nKey aspects include:\n\n1. Development of robust metrics and risk indicators for ESG risks, necessitating strong data processes.\n2. Consideration of different time horizons when defining business models.\n3. The necessity for institutions to utilize both available data and improve the collection of ESG-related information from clients and counterparties.\n4. Compliance with regulatory frameworks, including adherence to guidelines issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA) concerning minimum standards for the management of ESG risks.\n\nCompetent authorities, such as BaFin, will assess these practices within the supervisory review and evaluation process, highlighting the importance of maintaining resilience against the negative impacts of ESG factors amidst the transition to a sustainable economy.\n\nSOURCES (all columns):\n"

         "BA considers that there is a need to incorporate such a requirement as part of the ESG risk \nmanagement guidelines and therefore the preferred option is Option 1 : ESG risks should be \nconsidered in banks’ business models and strategies considering different  time horizon s. \nAdditionally, given the distinctive impacts of ESG risks across different time horizons, banks \nshould consider different  (including a long -term ) time horizons when defining their business \nmodels.  \n \n4) Data processes  \n \nA robust risk management framework heavily relies on data to develop robust metrics and risk \nindicators. Well defined, strong data processes are key to adequately gather and exploit data to \nidentify and measure ESG risks . However, as explained in the EBA report on the m anagement \nand supervision of ESG risks for credit institutions and investment firms , the lack of data to \nidentify and measure ESG risks is one of the main challenges faced by institutions . The EBA has \nbalanced these two aspects when defining the way data processes sh ould  be integrated in \nbanks ’ ESG risk management guidelines. Given the importance of having accurate data to \nadequately measure ESG risks, it is considered that institutions sh ould  take action to better use \nand aggregate the data already available and that will be available as a result of EU and \ninternational developments on sustainability reporting on one hand  (e.g. CSRD/ESRS) , and on \n \n34 See report here . \nFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ESG RISKS  \n \n63 \n \nthe other hand, improve the availability of ESG data via the collection of relevant ESG \ninformation from their clients and counterparties as part of their business relationship. There \nare other ESG regulatory developments such as the Pillar 3 disclosure requirements as per \nArticle 449(a) of Regulation (EU) 2019/876  that also push institutions to take action in a similar \ndirection. However, the collection of detailed ESG -related data for all counterparties may create \nan excessive burden for institutions. In order to reduce such a burden, the EBA considers that \ninstitutions should be able to use  external data in line with the outsourcing framework , as well \nas proxies , expert judgments and portfolio -level assessments  in those cases where data is not \navailable or its collection via engagement with clients and counterparties is considered \nexcessively difficult",

      "BaFin's expectations regarding ESG risks are aligned with the guidelines set forth by the EBA in the context of managing financial risks associated with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Institutions are expected to systematically identify, measure, and manage ESG risks as part of their overall risk management frameworks. This involves assessing the potential financial impacts of ESG factors, including climate-related risks, on their risk profile and solvency over short, medium, and long-term horizons. \n\nFurthermore, BaFin emphasizes the integration of ESG considerations into institutions' business strategies, loan origination policies, and governance arrangements. Regulatory bodies may collaborate with environmental authorities to ensure robust risk management practices, and institutions must prepare comprehensive plans that include specific targets and timelines for addressing these risks, in line with the EU's objectives for achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Overall, BaFin expects continuous development and implementation of effective ESG risk management practices to enhance the resilience and sustainability of financial institutions.\n"
